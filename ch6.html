<p>In this chapter, we will discuss some principles of information and knowledge management as it relates to organizations. We will touch on Senge’s concept of <strong>learning organizations</strong> and Choo’s elaborations of this concept into the theoretical framework of <strong>knowing organizations</strong>. We will also consider different tools and applications of these frameworks.</p>

<p>Organizations are entities that are made up of people working for a common purpose or goal. Fields such as Business, Finance, Management, Political Science, and others will categorize and define organizations as they relate to those fields. These fields of study may seek to analyze the hierarchies, structures, or success of different kinds of organization. There are many theoretical frameworks as to how organizations function and flourish, but we will focus on frameworks that discuss how organizations interact with information in order to meet their goals.</p>
<p>There are a variety of types of organizations, which may have different needs and structures, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Government</p></li>
<li><p>NGOs (Non-Government organizations, generally non-profits or charities)</p></li>
<li><p>Corporations</p></li>

<h2 data-number="6.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-learning-organization"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> The Learning Organization</h2>
<p>Business Management scholar Peter Senge developed the idea of the <strong>learning organization</strong>. He envisioned organizations that excelled in the face of rapid change through adaptability and informed decision making. He wrote that learning organizations are “…organizations where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning to see the whole together” <span class="citation" data-cites="senge2006">(<a href="#ref-senge2006" role="doc-biblioref">Senge 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Senge’s concept was influenced heavily by <strong>systems theory.</strong> Systems theory is an interdisciplinary term that explores how groups, systems, or individuals may interact together in a larger system. Broadly speaking, it can be described as how things can be greater than the sum of their parts. Senge explored his concept of learning organizations in relation to the <strong>systems theory of organizations –</strong> which seeks to describe and explain how the organization works as a whole to accomplish its goals. Senge wrote a framework of core principles for the learning organization, including the concept he called <strong>team learning.</strong> Senge describes team learning as a skill in which individuals within the organization can discuss and have dialogue with each other in order for the organization as a whole to learn and advance.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-knowing-organization"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> The Knowing Organization</h2>
<p>We can think of organizations from an information-based view in which the people in organizations are working with information to accomplish specific outcomes. Information Management scholar Chun Wei Choo created a framework in which these outcomes can be divided into three different categories; sense making, knowledge creation and decision making.</p>
<section id="sense-making" class="level3" data-number="6.4.1">
<h3 data-number="6.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sense-making"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.1</span> Sense making</h3>
<p>The act of sense making begins when there are changes in the environment which the organization must make sense of. The organization must balance the different interpretations of the messages and cues that arise from the changes.</p>
<p>There are four processes that an organization uses to make sense of its environment:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Ecological change</strong>. The beginning of sense making in which a change or difference in the organizational environment results in a disturbance.</li>
<li><strong>Enactment</strong>. the ways in which people construct the information. People construct the information in two ways. First, they selectively bracket, highlight or isolate the information by only paying attention to certain aspects of the information and ignoring others. Second, they create new features that help them to better understand the environment. After enactment finishes, the organization is left with a smaller set of information.</li>
<li><strong>Selection</strong>. People look at what information has been enacted and try to extract meaning from it. Interpretations that best fit with past understandings are selected .</li>
<li><strong>Retention</strong>. The information is retained for use in the future.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="knowledge-creation" class="level3" data-number="6.4.2">
<h3 data-number="6.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="knowledge-creation"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.2</span> Knowledge Creation</h3>
<p>Organizations must continuously create knowledge. Knowledge can be created by managing the relationship between explicit and tacit knowledge. <strong>Tacit knowledge</strong> is described as “personal knowledge that is hard to formalize or communicate to others” <span class="citation" data-cites="choo2005">(<a href="#ref-choo2005" role="doc-biblioref">Choo 2005</a>)</span>. These are such things as subjective know-hows and insights. <strong>Explicit knowledge</strong> is the opposite, it is formal knowledge that can easily be transmitted between both individuals and groups. Examples of this include formulas and instructions.</p>
<p>There are four different ways in which new knowledge can be created:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Socialization</strong>. Acquisition of knowledge through the sharing of experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Externalization</strong>. Using abstractions, metaphors, analogies or models to convert tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Combination</strong>. Combining explicit knowledge from different sources such as phone calls and meetings to create more explicit knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Internalization</strong>. Internalization happens when individuals within the organization are able to take tacit knowledge and use it for their own purposes, such as identifying information that is relevant to their specific work or tasks and using it.</li>
</ol>

<h3 data-number="6.4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decision-making"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.3</span> Decision Making</h3>
<p>When making decisions an individual is constrained by many different factors including their cognitive and mental capacities, the knowledge they already possess, and their values. The organization is able to control their members through the decision premises that decisions are made on, not on the actual decisions. There are two types of decision premises; value premises and factual premises. Value premises allows someone to figure out what is valuable about an alternative to help make the best possible decision. Factual premises helps the decision maker to determine what information is factual and relevant to the decision that needs to be made <span class="citation" data-cites="choo2005">(<a href="#ref-choo2005" role="doc-biblioref">Choo 2005</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-organizational-knowing-cycle"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.4</span> The Organizational Knowing Cycle</h3>
<p>Choo describes an organization’s flow from one “mode” to another as the Organizational Knowing Cycle.</p>
<p>“In the knowing cycle, a continuous flow of information is maintained between sensemaking, knowledge creating, and decision making, so that the outcome of information use in one mode provides the elaborated context and the expanded resources for information use in the other modes.” <span class="citation" data-cites="weichoo2001">(<a href="#ref-weichoo2001" role="doc-biblioref">Wei Choo 2001</a>)</span></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Choo comments that learning organizations will encourage and foster innovation through this cycle. Innovations and new concepts are created and then evaluated based on the organization’s needs and goals. Concepts which have been created are then tested and re-evaluated before being enacted in other levels of the organization to generate new cycles of knowledge creation.</p>

<section id="business-process-models" class="level3" data-number="6.4.5">
<h3 data-number="6.4.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="business-process-models"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.5</span> Business Process Models</h3>
<p>As we consider ways in which organizations can be learning and knowing, we can look at different tools that can help with sense-making, knowledge creation, and decision making. One such tool is the Business Process Model.</p>
<p>Business Process Models (BPMs) are a tool that people within the organization can use to visualize the flow of different processes – these tools can also help us visualize the information needs of the organization and individuals at each step of the process. As different individuals and departments in an organization may come together to complete a task, so too will the information needed to complete that task. By creating accurate BPMs, organizations can help create transparency for workers that allow information needs to be better identified and met.</p>
<p>BPMs will be discussed more in your Information Systems class, but we can develop a surface understanding of them in order to think of their usefulness in organizations. Each BPM will have a start point (where the process begins) and an end point (where the process is complete) and may describe different steps in a process for each individual involved. The steps for different individuals may be visually represented in different “lanes,” like in the below BPM for a restaurant process. The customer, host/hostess, waitstaff, chefs, and even the point of sales system are displayed in their own lane. Each lane outlines steps of how and when an individual will participate in the entire process.</p>

<p>By examining each step of the process, we can anticipate what sort of decisions individuals will have to make during their steps and seek to ensure they have the information that they need. By ensuring that individuals are equipped with the information they need to complete their steps, we can help to ensure that the organization is able to carry out the desired process.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedded-librarianship"><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Embedded Librarianship</h2>
<p>People tend to identify librarians based on the buildings they work in, thinking that “a librarian works in a library”. This is not always the case. As traditional reference services are becoming less common due to the rise of the internet and the changing role of libraries, librarians are moving out of physical libraries. Embedded librarianship occurs when librarians are embedded within organizations and institutions. These librarians develop strong relationships with the groups of people they work with such as faculty, students, a marketing department or a research team. Embedded librarians are knowledgeable on the work their team is working on <span class="citation" data-cites="shumaker2012">(<a href="#ref-shumaker2012" role="doc-biblioref">Shumaker 2012b</a>)</span>. “In order for librarians to be effective in the learning community, they must be viewed by all as a partner in the community. Real familiarity with the course and content is vital to change the perception of students that the librarian is ‘just visiting’ and is not an integral part of the learning community” <span class="citation" data-cites="muir2010">(<a href="#ref-muir2010" role="doc-biblioref">Muir and Heller-Ross 2010, 92</a>)</span></p>
<p>There are three main factors that define embedded librarianship and they include ongoing relationships, knowledge of and commitment to shared goals, and customized high value contributions <span class="citation" data-cites="shumaker2012">(<a href="#ref-shumaker2012" role="doc-biblioref">Shumaker 2012b</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Embedded librarians are able to anticipate their patrons needs, they don’t wait to be asked for help. They work for an entire team and help multiple people at once. Embedded librarians understand the needs of their team because they are so familiar with the project. “With embedded librarianship, transactions still occur- documents are requested, instructional sessions are held, or documents are added to a shared virtual workspace- but the emphases shifts from the transaction to the project” <span class="citation" data-cites="shumaker_defining_2012">(<a href="#ref-shumaker_defining_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Shumaker 2012a, 13</a>)</span>. Embedded librarianships are responsible for more than just providing a service.</p>

<p>It is not only embedded librarians that move outside of traditional library spaces. The following are a few different kinds of librarians you may find outside of the library. <span class="citation" data-cites="shumaker_defining_2012">(<a href="#ref-shumaker_defining_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Shumaker 2012a</a>)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Virtual librarians</strong>. Virtual librarians are available remotely (sometimes 24/7 due to time zones) through phone, email, instant messaging or texting. These librarians are similar to traditional librarians in that they are passively waiting to be asked for help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roving librarian</strong>. A librarian that sets up in different locations such as the classroom, or cafeteria. This librarian is different from embedded as they are still disconnected from the work the organization does, but are there to answer questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Personal librarian</strong>. First year undergraduate students are each assigned their own personal librarian that they can go to for research help throughout their degree. This doesn’t work so well with how many group projects are assigned in universities these days as each student would have a different librarian.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consulting librarian</strong>. Consulting librarians work with either a team or an individual client. They establish long term relationships and are always planning for the next project. The only drawback is that they aren’t always seen as part of the team.</p></li>

<p><em>Wren and Tracey are out for a walk at Point Pleasant on a sunny Saturday morning in October. Last spring the gang graduated from the MI program and have not seen each other since. The two are very excited to catch up and find out how everything has been going for the last few months.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Tracy! It feels like forever since I’ve seen you, it’s so good to finally catch up!</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: It does feel like it’s been ages, but time really does fly. Hey! Have you heard what Jude and Dante have been up to this summer?</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Yes- I actually grabbed dinner with them a couple weeks ago when they were visiting Halifax. Dante got an entry level position at South Shore Public Libraries and moved out to Lunenburg, and Jude has been working as a digital archivist at a professional organization in Quebec City.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: That’s awesome, it seems like they got just the sort of jobs they were looking for. How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: I’ve been so busy! I was offered a full-time position with the tech start-up that I did my practicum at starting right after we graduated, and it’s been going well. At my firm, we develop solutions for business to collect data from their environment and analyze it to monitor their performance and inform decisions. Our software has modules designed for different teams at various levels of the organization. I feel like the Information Management program really prepared me for this because I’m part of the bridge team that works with both the clients to understand their needs and the software development team. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: I have been doing consultant work. It can be quite intense though; it seems we move from one housefire to another. We mostly work with small businesses, especially those that are NGO’s or non-profits. But their infrastructure can be…messy. It is good, challenging work. I feel like I’m contributing to something good at the end of the day, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: It sounds like this job has the potential to be quite satisfying and fulfilling for you!</p>
<p><em>As they’re walking and talking Wren receives a notification on her phone. Opening her email, she finds out that the small company she works for has been bought out by a large corporate organization.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Oh, wow. That was an email from my boss to everyone in the office. Apparently, our company has just been acquired by a large organization! Good grief!</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: That will be a big change. I dealt with a similar situation at a job I had in my late twenties. The company I was working for was bought out by a corporation and everyone was really worried about how the transition would go.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Were people ok with the changes that came about?</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: It was a big challenge at first. It took some time, but eventually we ended up better off. I’m still connected with some of my old coworkers on LinkedIn and they’ve told me how happy they are with how the company culture has developed. In my past work I’ve also helped organizations determine their information needs and implement processes that address and meet them. But I agree with you – change is uncomfortable. There will be plenty of people at both companies that are feeling uncertain about the effects of the change. Do you know this new company?</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: I looked at jobs with them when I graduated, but they’re too big for me. I didn’t want to go full on corporate – no offence. I wanted someplace small where I could learn and see the impact of my work. Now, being absorbed by a corporate organization… I worry that it may get too bureaucratic and inhibit our efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: Yeah, no offence taken – I get it. And I totally agree about small businesses – you get to learn a lot about how they work. Trust me, they will want you to be a part of this. Especially since you understand the culture of your workplace. You can help new employees understand what is important to your team and make this work. What does communication look like in your current workplace?</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Since we’re a small team, communication largely happens in person, by email, and mostly on our shared whiteboard. It’s all a very fast paced environment with changes happening quickly. No one is really in charge, its mostly a collaborative team.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: Ah, I see. You guys do software… so the environment needs to be quite agile?</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Exactly! We move fast, minimize formal communication, and basically, just get stuff done! Now I feel like we’ll have many new external stakeholders to answer to, potentially delaying our ability to execute quickly. Our company used to decide on its own internal objectives, and now we will be tasked with answering to larger-scale goals and external determinants of value. Before we were happy to place user-centered design at the forefront of our company goals and our small successes were based on integrating customer feedback, but now at a corporate level, I’m not sure what benchmarks of success we will have to meet.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: Yeah….so change management is going to be critical here. There’s going to be some conflicts of work culture and communication methods. I hope they have someone that’s done this before.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Well, I feel like I know the company quite well; I’m not sure a larger company that is seeking to incorporate automated knowledge management software really appreciates the human perspective I bring to the table.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: I can understand why you might feel this way, it doesn’t feel great to have to constantly defend the importance of your role and the value you add to the information processes of your organization.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Yes, exactly, Tracy. In a smaller workplace environment, it was clear to see how employees were contributing with the work they did and to what degrees. Now, I might be tasked with writing multiple reports a year outlining how my position is critical to the success of the company.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: I’m sorry, Wren. If it makes you feel better, your friendship is invaluable to me and the rest of the gang. You are a fantastic communicator, though, so I think as long as you exercise those skills during this transitory period, everything will work out okay. Growing pains!</p>
<p>Consider the exchange of information and knowledge in the workplaces you have worked in and professional environments you have been a part of. Reflect on the importance of communication and how it impacts the success of an organization’s goals.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion-questions"><span class="header-section-number">6.6.1</span> Discussion Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>What do you think Wren’s company should do to ensure that there is a smooth transition with the merger? How can they ensure that the information flow stays efficient?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider your current or past places of work- how does information flow internally? How does it flow externally?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you find it easier to communicate in smaller team environments versus larger ones? How do communication processes change based on the size of the group? How are our environments influenced based on information processes?</p></li>
<li><p>Think about how these organizations fit into society in a larger context; what role do they play in facilitating communication and information flow on a societal level?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom pyramid. Does it seem relevant to the organizations you have worked in? How could you reimagine it based on the flow of information and exchange of knowledge in the organizations you have been a part of?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think there is a difference in how non-profit or government funded organisations share knowledge internally compared with for-profit</p></li>
