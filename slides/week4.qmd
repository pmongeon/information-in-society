## Information Behaviour {.smaller}

Information behaviour refers to the ways individuals:

-   **seek** information

-   **encounter** information (serendipity)

-   **use** information

-   **avoid** information

-   **produce/share** information

## Networks {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   A network is a system of nodes (entities) connected by edges (relationships).
-   Social networks (communities)
    -   From small networks (e.g., your reading club, or this classroom) to big networks (e.g., Swifties)
-   Technological networks
    -   Cloud computing, social media, internet, phones, cable, roads, the electric grid, etc.
-   Sociotechnical network
    -   Intertwined and interdependent social and technological networks.
-   Networked individualization:
    -   The use of technologies to develop social networks that provide sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging and identity.

## Informatic personhood {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   **Informatic context**

    -   Data interfaces: systems, devices, infrastructures, and objects that connect to data
    -   Data circulation: the dynamics of data (im)mobility
    -   Data abstraction: how data is processed and what we do with it through algorithms, big data, measures, machine learning, software, artificial intelligence, etc.

-   **Informatic perso**n: the subject who resides in the informatic context and attempts to sense-make and live meaningful through and with data.

## Standards, power, and marginalization {.smaller}

-   Every network is characterized by a more or less stable set of norms and standards, some of which can be extremely difficult to change once the network is stabilized.
-   Networks are not neutral and tend to involve power relationships
    -   e.g., Power to set norms/standards, to control data interfaces, circulation, and abstraction.
-   No one fits the standards and norms perfectly (marginalization as a continuum).
-   Participating on a network (i.e., existing?) comes at a cost.
-   **Multiplicity**: We exist and engage in multiple networks, each with their own structure, standards and norms.

## Performances {.smaller}

-   People perform roles in social settings, mainly to fit it.
-   Front stage: **managing impressions** for an audience (real or imagined),
-   Back stage: relaxing, not acting... being ourselves(?)
-   Are network the front stage(s) on which we perform?
-   Are all network performances public?

Goffman, E. (1956). *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*. Doubleday.

## Affordances {.smaller}

-   Coined by psychologist James J. Gibson (1979).
-   Refer to perceived possibilities for action in an environment.
-   From an information perspective:
    -   How users perceive and act on information systems, tools, and spaces.
    -   Opportunities and constraints for information behaviours.
    -   Opportunities and constraints for acting and managing impressions.
-   Different network stages have different affordances.

## The self {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Are we what we do?
    -   Existence precedes essence - Jean-Paul Sartre
    -   (Information) behaviour defines us?
-   Are we what we consume?
-   How do you think the information technologies that you do or don’t use shape your identity?
-   Are we defined by our performances?
-   Is there such a thing as an authentic self?
-   How much control do you have on the version of yourself that is presented to others in different context? How much can we actually manage our impressions?
-   If, as Sherry Turkle suggest, we are losing the ability to disengage from the networks, does it mean we are spending less time backstage being ourselves?

## Group discussion {.smaller}

-   In what ways might Wren’s online persona be authentic? In what ways might it be curated?  
-   Should workplaces punish people based on the content on their social media channels?
-   Is it OK for companies to look at personal social media accounts in the hiring process?
-   Would you consider social media and online platforms a private or public environment?
-   What online communities are you a part of? How do you manage your identity in these networks?
-   What information do you share online? Does this change based on the online space you are in?
-   Consider how technology facilitates or inhibits your ability to interact in your in-person and online networks?
-   Consider the differences (or similarities) in how you interact with friends, professional colleagues, or other groups online versus in person. What are the benefits or drawbacks of this?
