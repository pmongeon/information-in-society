## Analysis of an information setting {.scrollable .smaller}

**Instructions\
**Choose a physical, virtual, or hybrid setting where information phenomena are occurring. You can be creative and choose a setting where information is not the first thing that comes to mind (e.g., an emergency room or a game of Monopoly). It can also be a personal space (e.g., your kitchen or home office). Avoid choosing a setting that is too large to be fully observed (e.g., Dalhousie University in Halifax or the internet).

**Submit\
**An approximately 1,500-word text including:

1.  A brief description of the setting.
2.  The type(s) of data/information/knowledge are at play in the setting.
3.  The function(s) of information in the setting.
4.  The interactions between people and information in the setting.
5.  The factors that facilitate or hinder the information processes (e.g., use, access, exchange, etc.) in the setting.
6.  The impact of technologies on the setting.
7.  The implications/opportunities for information professionals.
