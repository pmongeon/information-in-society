## Today's plan

-   ISSA presentation
-   Short presentation + open discussions
-   Fun

## What's in a name?

If we are going to call ourselves information specialists, experts, professionals, managers, scientists, etc., it seems appropriate that we should seek to understand what it is that we are experts of...

## What is information?

# Fun time

## Your task

-   **Goal**: Create a visual representation of the concept of information and its relationship to other concepts.
-   **Time**: Up until 11am
-   **Rules**: None.

## Bates information {.scrollable .smaller}

**Embedded information**: The pattern of organization of the enduring

effects of the presence of animals on the earth; may be incidental, as a

path through the woods, or deliberate, as a fashioned utensil or tool.

**Embodied** **information**: The corporeal expression or manifestation of

information previously in encoded form.

**Encoded** **information**: Natural information that has symbolic, linguistic,

and/or signal-based patterns of organization.

Enacted information: The pattern of organization of actions of an animal

in, and interacting with, its environment, utilizing capabilities and

experience from its neural stores.

**Experienced** **information**: The pattern of organization of subjective

experience, the feeling of being in life, of an animal.

**Exosomatic** **information**: Information stored in durable form external to

the body (Idea drawn from Goonatilake, 1991).

**Expressed** **information**: The pattern of organization of communicatory

scents, calls, gestures, and ultimately, human spoken language used to

communicate among members of a species and between species.

**Genetic information**: Information contained in the genotype.

**Genotype**: The genetic constitution of a living thing (drawn from standard

definitions in the biological literature).

**Information 1**: The pattern of organization of matter and energy.

**Information 2**: Some pattern of organization of matter and energy given

meaning by a living being.

**Knowledge**: Information given meaning and integrated with other

contents of understanding.

**Natural information**: All information is natural information, in that it

exists in the material world of matter and energy. Represented

information (below) is an important subset of natural information.

**Neural**-**cultural** information: Information that has been created by,

processed in, or disseminated from animal nervous systems, especially

human nervous systems. (Neural information may also be used for

lower animals and/or specifically for the nervous system structures that

make memory and action possible in general in animals and humans.)

**Phenotype**: The genetically and environmentally determined embodiment

of a genotype. (Drawn from standard definitions in the biological

literature.)

**Recorded information**: Communicatory or memorial information

preserved in a durable medium.

**Represented information**: Natural information that is encoded or

embodied.

**Trace information**: The pattern of organization of the residue that is

incidental to living processes or which remains after living processes

are finished with it.
