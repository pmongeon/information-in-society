<p>This week’s discussion is around the concept of attention economy that is fundamentally distinct from the information economy (but not entirely seperated from it) because it is an economy where information tends to be free.</p>

<p>If information is free, then what are the commodities that are produced, owned and sold in this new market?</p>

<p>We will also explore one of the corollary of this new economy, which is a heightened capacity for surveillance of individuals and the resulting threat to privacy.</p>
<p>Note that because of the ongoing strike, there will not be a chapter for this week (just the case study below). I might have a PowerPoint and some videos for us to watch in class, which I will post here afterwards.</p>

<p><em>An outbreak has sent countries across the globe into lockdown. Jude works at the Nova Scotia Archives, and they have directed their employees to work from home in accordance with provincial regulations. Jude initially finds a stable routine helpful; he wakes up in the morning, takes his dog Kevin on a walk, and then begins his workday. As the months go by, Jude finds himself consuming more and more online content instead of doing the things he regularly enjoys. Jude begins to immerse himself heavily in the perspectives of certain online forums and media. The gang grows concerned with Jude’s online behaviours and collectively check in with him in their group chat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Info Masters: Group Chat</strong></p>
<p><em>3:07am</em></p>
<p><strong>In_perpe_jude_ity87</strong>: Hey friends, check out this YouTube video when you get a chance- really interesting perspective… not something you’ll hear on the mainstream media.</p>
<p><em>9:45am</em></p>
<p><strong>Trace_2_face_consultation</strong>: Good morning Jude, et al.&nbsp;I see you were up really late Jude, were you just watching videos all night?</p>
<p><strong>Dantes_infern0</strong>: Rise and shine team! Let’s manage information 😊</p>
<p><strong>tWrending_in_tech</strong>: Good morn!! Hmm… I saw this the other day when it was floating around the internet… but only cause I’ve got to keep my finger on the pulse of the web and not because it’s content I usually watch… where did you find this, Jude?</p>
<p><strong>In_perpe_jude_ity87</strong>: Haha, yeah, I was up pretty late. I just kinda fell down a rabbit hole in this online forum I’m a part of and next thing I knew it was 3am. Gotta stop doing that! Let me know what you think about the video.</p>
<p><strong>Trace_2_face_consultation</strong>: Oh dear- Jude, it sounds like nights like that have become the norm? That doesn’t seem like a very healthy lifestyle. Why are you up so late every night?</p>
<p><strong>Dantes_infern0</strong>: From the activity logs I can view on the social sites we’re all a part of you seem pretty active on a few different pages and groups. Take a break, my Jude!</p>
<p><strong>In_perpe_jude_ity87</strong>: I don’t need a break. I’m just really curious and interested in learning about viewpoints I’ve never been exposed to. I’ve been finding so much new information from videos and articles shared in these groups.</p>
<p><strong>tWrending_in_tech</strong>: Awe, Jude- we’ve always loved your love of analog formats! So, this comes as a bit of a surprise. It seems like your attention has been captivated by these groups- just based on what I see you reposting and chatting about! (Please don’t be mad, just checking in- ily)</p>
<p>Trace_2_face_consultation: Well said, Wren! I remember when I first got a few online platforms- I couldn’t tear myself away! There was always new and exciting information out there and everything always felt so urgent. I was afraid to log off and miss new content.</p>
<p><strong>Dantes_infern0</strong>: Hahaha- when I first got Facebook, I remember joining so many groups dedicated to raising tropical fish. I got REALLY into it, but after a while, I realized the algorithm was designed to show me things I liked and interacted with. It kind of becomes a positive feedback loop. I’m still leaving fish groups, and that was 5 years ago. I also purchased a fair few fish tanks- dang targeted ads!</p>
<p><strong>tWrending_in_tech</strong>: Hilarious, because I’ve never seen you keep a plant alive for more than a week. Dante’s inferno indeed. Jude, as someone who works in tech, could I kindly suggest that you be careful about where you are investing your attention and time? Some online sites and apps are designed to capture and monetize your attention and aren’t necessarily concerned with the well-being of users… they’re more interested in generating traffic on their sites.</p>
<p><strong>In_perpe_jude_ity87</strong>: No one is forcing me to be active on these groups though… the algorithm is working because I’m genuinely interested in this stuff. It’s free, too! The users are the ones creating all the content. I appreciate your concern, but I think I just get really into stuff, like the time I got back into baking sourdough bread at the start of the outbreak LOL.</p>
<p><strong>Trace_2_face_consultation</strong>: Thanks for that perspective, Wren! It is so easy to feel like we are in control because we are the ones clicking, but many online business models are designed to keep us on their sites. Our attention is a resource and should be protected and treated as such! Remember our Professor in Info in Society in first year telling us “If it’s free, you are the product”? It seems like the information you are finding is a valuable asset here but in reality, the data we provide is more valuable to these companies than the information we obtain from them… at least monetarily. And I understand that, Jude. You are someone who is wholeheartedly invested in what you care about, and that is such a wonderful characteristic of yours! But often our strengths and weaknesses go hand in hand- there is no harm in baking bread, but the viewpoints and content you are consuming so much of can potentially be a bit dangerous, in insidious ways.</p>
<p><strong>Dantes_infern0</strong>: I saw a documentary about this recently! These sites are gathering and selling our data. They want users on their sites as long as possible to offer up more of their personal information. They track user behaviours so that they have more generated data to sell. It’s a cycle. Some people get in the habit of consuming information non-stop and don’t realize what they are offering in exchange for it.</p>
<p><strong>tWrending_in_tech</strong>: Agreed! That’s why I cap my screen time now and only go on my social sites intentionally and with premeditated purpose. Otherwise, I just scroll endlessly!</p>
<p><strong>In_perpe_jude_ity87</strong>: I’m surprised by your reactions. I just shared a video I thought was interesting and didn’t mean to cause an entire discourse on the commodification of our attention… talk about diverting attention away from the main point.</p>
<p><strong>tWrending_in_tech</strong>: We just want to make sure you are okay, Jude! With so much information and online content being created non-stop, the only limiting factor is really our attention. I have learned to be more mindful since working in tech. As someone with the inside scoop when it comes to algorithms, they have the potential to create and reinforce stereotypes, biases, and oppression. It’s our social responsibility to be cognizant of that fact and question what we are consuming and why. That’s just one techie’s opinion!</p>
<p><strong>In_perpe_jude_ity87</strong>: Well, thanks for your concern, folks. I’ll take your advice and log off- I’ve got to get back to work. The fonds won’t fawn over themselves, haha. Ttyl!</p>
<p><strong>Trace_2_face_consultation</strong>: Thanks for the morning chat, all! Glad we got to check in with you, Jude!</p>
<p><strong>Dantes_infern0</strong>: Yeah- this convo has made me consider public libraries’ roles in protecting patrons’ privacy and not revealing what resources are used and by whom. I’m going to go see what books we carry on these topics.</p>
<p><strong>tWrending_in_tech</strong>: And I’ll get back to my big evil tech company! Bahaha &gt;:) jk. Have a lovely day all!</p>
<p><em>Chat ended.</em></p>
<p>Consider the themes discussed in the group chat. The gang observes that Jude’s attention has been monopolized by online groups sharing distinct points of view. They raise concerns over Jude’s level of awareness regarding the commodification of user attention and urge him to be mindful of this fact as he navigates online landscapes.</p>

<h2 data-number="8.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion-questions"><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Discussion Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Would you consider Jude’s online behaviours healthy?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider how Jude exists as a user in online settings: do you think he feels/is in control? Do you feel as though he possesses a level of awareness regarding the time he is spending online and the ways in which he is interacting with content?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you feel as though you have a level of agency over the information you provide online? When you offer up your data to online sites, does it transform from personal information into a commodity? How do you perceive personal versus collective versus organizational ownership of data online? Is this based on how it was created/generated, or by whom?</p></li>
<li><p>Is our data inherently of value? How is value added to the data we generate digitally? Through context? Through metadata?</p></li>
<li><p>To what degree are you informed about the ways online sites use your information? Is it important to you to be aware of how your attention is captured and commodified? In what ways can we facilitate greater awareness surrounding the attention economy in ourselves and in others?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we ensure equitable access to information in an ethical way?</p></li>
