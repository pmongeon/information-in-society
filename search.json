As we will see in this chapter, information management degrees are about a lot more than librarianship and can provide you with many opportunities.

ALA-accredited degrees are generally a requirement for a range of positions in libraries of all kinds and other related organizations. Accordingly, most students reading this chapter are likely to be interested in pursuing a career in librarianship. Many of you, however, are in this program with completely different careers in mind, and you may be surprised by the emphasis on libraries. Perhaps some of you just have no prior thoughts about the program or the field as you are taking this course as an elective, or simply because you ended up here randomly. Whatever group you might find yourself in, now that you are here you might be surprised by the breadth of the discipline and the many professional pathways that it can lead you down. Who knows, maybe you joined the program to be a children services librarian, and will come out of it an aspiring data scientist? So, what are the information professions? Marcia Bates (2015) referred to our discipline as a meta-discipline that spans across the entire spectrum of traditional research disciplines, from the Arts and Humanities to the Natural Science. While it is by no means comprehensive, this figure from Bates (2015) was an attempt to illustrate the breath of the discipline by situating many of the sub-disciplines across that spectrum.\nThe diversity of the information profession can also be observed through the many job titles that the MLIS jobs report shows.\nThis degree does not just lead to librarianship or working as an archivist, in fact there are many different job titles that an MI can lead to.

    "text": "1.3 Skills to succeed as an information professional\nAlthough we will narrow in on a few different career options in the following sections, there are some core skills that have been mentioned as valuable regardless of the direction you choose. San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management. You can learn more about the different roles, job duties you may encounter and the skills you will need to be successful. There is also more information on the professional values of each sector and the professional associations that you may be able to join."

    "section": "1.4 Public Librarianship",
    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

These include but are not limited to access and reference services librarian, outreach and diversity librarian, materials and image librarian, and staff engagement liaison. Although there are so many different titles within academic librarianship there are some job duties that appear often. These include reference assistance, assisting faculty in research and teaching research, delivering courses on research, creating LibGuides, helping to select which journals to purchase, analyzing usage statistics and outreach and marketing (MLIS Skills at Work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.2 Skills\nThere are some skills that you should be working on if you are looking to work within an academic library. These include knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet and data applications, knowledge of the open access movement and the scholarly publishing industry, multitasking, interpersonal skills, customer service and knowledge of copyright practices (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.3 Professional values\nWhen it comes to professional values, academic librarianship has very similar values to public librarianship such as access, diversity, preservation, education and privacy (Core values of librarianship, 2019).\n\n\n1.5.4 Professional Associations\nLibrary associations are formed so that librarians with similar interests can come together to share ideas. Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\n1.5.5 Special Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\n1.5.6 Jobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.7 Skills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

You may end up as a medical content reference librarian, a medical research librarian, or a health sciences librarian. Some job duties you may encounter in health librarianship include creating search acquisition strategies, keyword searches, managing SEO campaigns, packaging research data into insightful deliverables and planning, promoting and administering library services and resources (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.2 Skills\nSome skills that are important for those working in this field include research and analysis skills, project management skills, the ability to prioritize and multitask, excellent oral and written skills, and being proficient at searching online databases (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.3 Professional Values\nThe Special Library Association states on their website that the core professional values of special librarianship are leadership, service, results and accountability, collaboration and partnering and innovation and continuous learning (Abram, 2019).\n\n\n1.6.4 Professional Associations\nThere are also professional associations related to special libraries. For example, there is the Special Libraries Association. There are also associations dedicated specifically to health librarianship including the Canadian Health Libraries Association and the Medical Library Association. And associations for law librarianship including the American Association of Law Libraries and the Canadian Association of Law Libraries.\n\n\n1.6.5 Data Management\n\n\n1.6.6 Jobs\nThere are so many different jobs in the data management field. Some sample job titles include Data analytics manager, data librarian, data visualization and GIS specialist, and manager of data governance. Some duties you may encounter within these roles include leading a university library’s research data services initiative, partnering with researchers to advance the knowledge and management of data, or answering questions on data management for faculty and staff at a university (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.7 Skills\nSome of the skills that you may need to work in data management include experience working with complicated datasets, knowledge of data software such as tableau, and an understanding of information management practices such as carrying out data needs assessments (MLIS skills at work, 2022). If you have a passion for data, consider tailoring your courses to working with data. Courses such as data science and data management will help you to learn the skills you need to succeed. Digital librarianship Jobs With the world shifting towards more online content, digitization is becoming more and more important making digital librarianship is a worthwhile field of librarianship to pursue. Digital librarianship can have many different job titles including digital collections manager, electronic resources librarian, virtual resources librarian or digital and automated services librarian. When working in digital librarianship you may find yourself supervising activities related to the digitization of collections, providing consultation and technical support for the development of technology reliant research projects or engaging in the assessment, maintenance and enhancement of digital collections and services (MLIS skills at work, 2022). Skills If you are interested in digital librarianship, it could be helpful to take extra advanced technology courses during your degree. This will help you to gain the skills you need for the field such as ability to learn new technologies quickly, experience with metadata, knowledge of digitization standards and an interest in electronic information sources and organizations (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nStephanie Bilodeau\nManager, Open Government and Data Governance\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police – IM/IT Program\nStephanie wears two hats with her job at the RCMP, she is the manager of Open Government and the manager of Data Governance. There is a big need for these positions because programmers created systems to store data but more needs to be done to organize and manage that data. They have found that when using these systems things aren’t accurate, queries are not always pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech focused so it’s important to know how information is managed through IT systems. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.\nThe Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired to a government position. They offer full time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also have the ability to bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html\nThe best advice Stephanie would give is to be open minded and willing to learn constantly. Always try new things and make sure that the work you are doing is aligned with your organizations’ mission and corporate vision."

Some of the roles that fall under knowledge management include knowledge synthesizer, knowledge analyst, knowledge navigator and of course knowledge manager. Some of the main duties you may encounter within this field are handling a company’s knowledge management operations, formulating a knowledge management strategy, managing knowledge management staff and influencing change within an organization. Tasks you may be asked to perform include curating technical website content, designing and implementing effective learning activities and managing knowledge sharing events (Postolache, 2019). Skills If you are looking to become a knowledge manager it is possible to obtain a knowledge management certificate on top of your degree to increase your chances of employment (Postolache, 2019).\n\n\n1.7.2 Professional Values\n????????????????????\n\n\n1.7.3 Professional Associations\n????????????????????\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nTrecia enrolled in the MLIS program at McGill University and specialized in knowledge management to learn how to best share knowledge. During her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their business information center, and she learned that efficient knowledge sharing strategies rely on a good understanding of your audience. Knowledge management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and you must constantly re-evaluate to make sure that the collected resources are useful for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now a community services librarian managing the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the Books-by-Mail service. Her job involves public relations and communications, outreach, and programming. One of her main focuses is community led programming, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that best fits their communities’ needs. She finds that programming works best when there is a commitment from the community to participate. Community led programming begins with conversations with patrons to try to determine what programs they would like to see. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, a lot of important skills are required of a successful community services librarian. Communication is important, especially formal communication, everything from social media etiquette to doing media press releases. You need to be able to speak with media outlets as a representative of the library at public tables. Management and leadership skills are also necessary along with time management, project management and knowledge management. Public speaking skills are necessary as you would be giving presentations and teaching staff, as well as running public workshops and programs. Experience with research and report writing is also an asset.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information, the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.9 Archives\n\n1.9.1 Jobs\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian. Some job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public (MLIS skills at work, 2022)\n\n\n1.9.2 Skills\nSome skills you may need to work in these positions include an ability to work independently as well as in a group, knowledge of intellectual property issues, and knowledge of standards of archival description and bibliographic control (MLIS Skills at work, 2022). Dalhousie offers courses in archives that will provide you with the skills you need to be successful in your career such as Archives 1 and 2. You are also able to complete a work practicum or internship within an archive to gain direct experience.\n\n\n1.9.3 Professional values\nSome of the core values of archivists include access and use, accountability, advocacy, diversity, history and memory, preservation, responsible stewardship, selection, service, social responsibility, and sustainability. If you want to learn more about these core values which were published the Society of American Archivists, take a look at their website (Society of American Archivists, 2020).\n\n\n1.9.4 Professional associations\nIf you are looking to join any professional associations for archivists there is the Association of Canadian Archivists, along with the Canadian Council of Archives. Each province also has its own council or association. Nova Scotia has the Council of Nova Scotia Archives. Click on the links to learn more about each association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor Council of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access. Sharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current. Sharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented. The best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

ALA-accredited degrees are generally a requirement for a range of positions in libraries of all kinds and other related organizations. Accordingly, most students reading this chapter are likely to be interested in pursuing a career in librarianship. Many of you, however, are in this program with completely different careers in mind, and you may be surprised by the emphasis on libraries. Perhaps some of you just have no prior thoughts about the program or the field as you are taking this course as an elective, or simply because you ended up here randomly. Whatever group you might find yourself in, now that you are here you might be surprised by the breadth of the discipline and the many professional pathways that it can lead you down. Who knows, maybe you joined the program to be a children services librarian, and will come out of it an aspiring data scientist? So, what are the information professions? Marcia Bates (2015) referred to our discipline as a meta-discipline that spans across the entire spectrum of traditional research disciplines, from the Arts and Humanities to the Natural Science. While it is by no means comprehensive, this figure from Bates (2015) was an attempt to illustrate the breath of the discipline by situating many of the sub-disciplines across that spectrum.\nThe diversity of the information profession can also be observed through the many job titles that the MLIS jobs report shows.\nThis degree does not just lead to librarianship or working as an archivist, in fact there are many different job titles that an MI can lead to. The following is a diverse list of job titles that you may find when looking for work in the MI field. Why don’t you take a look through these titles and see if any of them interest you, and then do a little bit of research to learn more?"

    "text": "1.3 Skills to succeed as an information professional\nAlthough we will narrow in on a few different career options in the following sections, there are some core skills that have been mentioned as valuable regardless of the direction you choose. San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management. You can learn more about the different roles, job duties you may encounter and the skills you will need to be successful. There is also more information on the professional values of each sector and the professional associations that you may be able to join."

    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\n1.5.5 Special Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\n1.5.6 Jobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.7 Skills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

This will help you to gain the skills you need for the field such as ability to learn new technologies quickly, experience with metadata, knowledge of digitization standards and an interest in electronic information sources and organizations (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nStephanie Bilodeau\nManager, Open Government and Data Governance\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police – IM/IT Program\nStephanie wears two hats with her job at the RCMP, she is the manager of Open Government and the manager of Data Governance. There is a big need for these positions because programmers created systems to store data but more needs to be done to organize and manage that data. They have found that when using these systems things aren’t accurate, queries are not always pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech focused so it’s important to know how information is managed through IT systems. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.\nThe Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired to a government position. They offer full time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also have the ability to bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html\nThe best advice Stephanie would give is to be open minded and willing to learn constantly. Always try new things and make sure that the work you are doing is aligned with your organizations’ mission and corporate vision."

During her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their business information center, and she learned that efficient knowledge sharing strategies rely on a good understanding of your audience. Knowledge management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and you must constantly re-evaluate to make sure that the collected resources are useful for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now a community services librarian managing the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the Books-by-Mail service. Her job involves public relations and communications, outreach, and programming. One of her main focuses is community led programming, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that best fits their communities’ needs. She finds that programming works best when there is a commitment from the community to participate. Community led programming begins with conversations with patrons to try to determine what programs they would like to see. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, a lot of important skills are required of a successful community services librarian. Communication is important, especially formal communication, everything from social media etiquette to doing media press releases. You need to be able to speak with media outlets as a representative of the library at public tables. Management and leadership skills are also necessary along with time management, project management and knowledge management. Public speaking skills are necessary as you would be giving presentations and teaching staff, as well as running public workshops and programs. Experience with research and report writing is also an asset.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information, the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.9 Archives\n\n1.9.1 Jobs\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian. Some job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public (MLIS skills at work, 2022)\n\n\n1.9.2 Skills\nSome skills you may need to work in these positions include an ability to work independently as well as in a group, knowledge of intellectual property issues, and knowledge of standards of archival description and bibliographic control (MLIS Skills at work, 2022). Dalhousie offers courses in archives that will provide you with the skills you need to be successful in your career such as Archives 1 and 2. You are also able to complete a work practicum or internship within an archive to gain direct experience.\n\n\n1.9.3 Professional values\nSome of the core values of archivists include access and use, accountability, advocacy, diversity, history and memory, preservation, responsible stewardship, selection, service, social responsibility, and sustainability. If you want to learn more about these core values which were published the Society of American Archivists, take a look at their website (Society of American Archivists, 2020).\n\n\n1.9.4 Professional associations\nIf you are looking to join any professional associations for archivists there is the Association of Canadian Archivists, along with the Canadian Council of Archives. Each province also has its own council or association. Nova Scotia has the Council of Nova Scotia Archives. Click on the links to learn more about each association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor Council of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access. Sharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current. Sharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented. The best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management.

    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

These include but are not limited to access and reference services librarian, outreach and diversity librarian, materials and image librarian, and staff engagement liaison. Although there are so many different titles within academic librarianship there are some job duties that appear often. These include reference assistance, assisting faculty in research and teaching research, delivering courses on research, creating LibGuides, helping to select which journals to purchase, analyzing usage statistics and outreach and marketing (MLIS Skills at Work, 2022).\n\n\nSkills\nThere are some skills that you should be working on if you are looking to work within an academic library. These include knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet and data applications, knowledge of the open access movement and the scholarly publishing industry, multitasking, interpersonal skills, customer service and knowledge of copyright practices (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\nProfessional values\nWhen it comes to professional values, academic librarianship has very similar values to public librarianship such as access, diversity, preservation, education and privacy (Core values of librarianship, 2019).\n\n\nProfessional Associations\nLibrary associations are formed so that librarians with similar interests can come together to share ideas. Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\nSpecial Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\nJobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\nSkills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

Some of the roles that fall under knowledge management include knowledge synthesizer, knowledge analyst, knowledge navigator and of course knowledge manager. Some of the main duties you may encounter within this field are handling a company’s knowledge management operations, formulating a knowledge management strategy, managing knowledge management staff and influencing change within an organization. Tasks you may be asked to perform include curating technical website content, designing and implementing effective learning activities and managing knowledge sharing events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nTrecia\nCommunity Services Librarian, and Managing Branch Librarian of the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the regional Borrow-by-Mail service.\nTrecia enrolled in the MLIS program at McGill University and specialized in Knowledge Management to learn how to best share knowledge. During the final term of her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their International Intellectual Properties Division, and there she learned that effective knowledge gathering and sharing strategies rely on a sound understanding of your audiences. Knowledge Management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and constantly re-evaluating knowledge purpose and use to ensure that the collected resources are of value for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now the Community Services Librarian, and Managing Branch Librarian of the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the regional Borrow-by-Mail service. In addition, her job portfolio covers the regional areas of responsibilities for Public Relations and Communications, Programming, Outreach, and Services for Adults. One of her main focuses is developing Community-Led programs and services, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that is responsive to their communities' needs. She finds that programming works best when there is engagement with the community to participate. Community-Led programming begins with conversations with the community-at-large and other community service providers to try to determine programs and services of interest and value. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, some important skills required of a successful public librarians and public library staff include communication and leadership. Communication is critically important, especially formal communication skills such as being comfortable with public speaking (to give presentations and leading workshops), understanding the evolving social media etiquette, to crafting effective media releases and grant applications (and reports). Management and leadership skills, along with solid project management experience are key to creating a healthy, responsive, and thriving workplace environment.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information - the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.7 Archives\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian.\nWhile archives and libraries have many points in common, they have important difference that often sets them apart as clearly distinct fields. Archival records are very different than bibliographic records. They tend to be created and maintained for different purposes, and guided by a different set of principles and philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nThe School of Information Management offers several archives courses and a an archives certificate that you can complete as part of your MI degree. There are also practicum and internship opportunities available for you to gain experience.\n\n\nSome job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public. To get more information about the archives field, you can check out the websites of the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Canadian Council of Archives, and the Council of Nova Scotia Archives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor\nCouncil of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access.\nSharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current.\nSharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented.\nThe best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

    "text": "1.6 Public libraries\nSome job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include programming, organizing the collection, building community partnerships, answering information requests, providing information literacy training, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses.\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\nThere are many professional associations for you to check out if you are interested in public libraries, such as the Public Library Association (a division of the American Library Association), the Nova Scotia Library Association (free membership for students).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professionals\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents.\nThe Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles.\nThere are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way.\nOne piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management.\nSome of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling.\nThere are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions.\nIf looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to.\nWhile you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for.\nThe best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

They have found that when using these systems things aren’t accurate, queries are not always pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy.

Depending on the type of museum, these libraries and archives can be part of the collections, or exist to support the museums activities. For example, a good exhibit might rely on having done research on the topic and its social or historical context, or on specific items that are part of the exhibit. Then you can think of museums as just another type of organization where librarian or archivists are needed.\nAnother key role for information professionals in museums involves dealing with information systems and users. Museums increasingly have online collections and databases to support them. These require a set of competencies and skills, such as database management, organization of information, and user-centered web design, that you will be able to develop during your MI degree.\nMore generally, the close relationship between the information and museum fields may be blurry enough that your information degree could help you compete for any type of museum role. especially if you have a background in the arts and humanities, or another area that is relevant for a particular museum.\nTo get a better sense of the jobs available in the museum space, check out the Canadian Museums Association (https://museums.ca/) and their job board."

There are also practicum and internship opportunities available for you to gain experience.\nTo get more information about the archives field, you can check out the websites of the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Canadian Council of Archives, and the Council of Nova Scotia Archives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor\nCouncil of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access.\nSharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current.\nSharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented.\nThe best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

All organizations have produce and need information to support their operations, by collecting and organizing data, documents, and archives, and managing information systems that support the day to day activities of organizations. Information professionals also have an educational role, by providing data, information literacy, and information technology training to patrons in public libraries, students, and colleagues in any type of work environment, and by gathering and organizing teaching materials to support educators. Information professionals also play an important role in supporting research in academic, governmental, non-profit, and corporate settings. Information professionals can also play a key role in fulfilling the culture and entertainment mission of organizations such as public libraries and museums.\n\n“Because of differences in goals and in the basic principles that underlie the various disciplines represented in the information profession, it is difficult, if not impossible, to express a single set of values across the information professions.” (Koehler, 2003, p. 109)\n\nStill there is a core set of values that exists within our field and tend to be promoted in our programs, and professional associations. The following are examples of core values in the information profession, adapted from Gorman (2015). These values may reflect the historical focus of the field (and of Goman’s book) on libraries, but they are also broad principles that can be relevant and applied in a wide range fo professional settings.\n\nStewardship\nGathering, organizing, preserving information for future use\nService\nBeing of service to our users, colleagues, and communities\nIntellectual freedom\nProtecting the right of people to hold, share and access ideas without restrictions\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion\nEnsuring that every individual and groups have access to information, can participate in the production of information, and be adequately represented in information.\nPrivacy protecting the privacy of individuals and activities\nLiteracy and learning\nPromoting reading and lifelong learning.\nDemocracy\nSupporting democracy and democratic principles.\nSocial responsibility\nWorking to make the world a better place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to think about\n\n\n\nThink about some of the type of work and organization that interests you as a future information professional.\n\nCan you think of ways in which the roles, values and principles listed would apply to that setting?\nAre there roles or values that are not relevant in this context?\nAre there others values or roles that you can mobilize as an information expert in this context?"

    "text": "Democracy literally means government by the people. There are two primary forms of democracy: one in which the people participate in policy and decision-making directly through their vote (direct democracy) or indirectly by electing representatives who exercise political power on their behalf (representative democracy). Most democracies today are representative democracies. According to Webster (2014), four essential elements need to be in place for a democracy to exist: regular elections and re-elections, a plurality of political parties, a secret ballot, and the universal right to vote. Then, additional factors can be considered to determine whether a democracy is a strong or a weak one. In other words, we can think of some kind of democratic ideal that can only be imperfectly implemented in society, and we may seek at any point in time to question how near or far we are from that ideal and what can be done to bring us closer to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of some factors that can make a democracy stronger or weaker?\n\n\nIn your reflection, you may have identified many factors related to information, which is perhaps not a surprise given that democracy is one of the core values of the information field that we discussed in the first chapter of this book. If you look more closely and think about it, you are likely to realize that pretty much all of the values of the field relate to or support, in some way, the democratic ideal. Let us dive into it a little bit.\nFirst, the value of rationality is strongly connected to the democratic ideal, which is not simply about people deciding, but about the ability of the deciding people to use reason or logic to inform their decision. For this ideal of rationality to be attained, people must be informed so they can consider all relevant facts and ideas (including views opposing their own). This highlights the importance of another core value of the field, intellectual freedom, which is about the rights of people to hold, share and access ideas without restrictions. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine individual voters as perfectly rational agents if they do not have access to all the required information or the ability to share that information with others. Even if, hypothetically, all the relevant data or information would be made available and thus, in theory, accessible, it does not necessarily mean that it can be accessed and processed by everyone in practice. This is where another value of the information field comes in: literacy. Information literacy, data literacy, and all the other literacies that we care about in the field are ways to empower individuals to find, evaluate, process, and use information so that they can improve their lives, fully participate in society, and embody the democratic ideal as rational agents. Finally, while it may not be directly linked to the values of the field, participation is a crucial element of a properly functioning democracy since having perfectly rational and well-informed agents serve little purpose if only a handful of them take the time to exercise their right to vote. If we interpret the concept of participation more broadly as being engaged in political discussions (i.e., taking part in the production and consumption of information), we can say how a lack of it may also hinder access to information and undermine our potential for rationality. Moreover, unbalanced participation, where only some voices are being heard, can also have a negative effect on the quality of democratically made decisions. This brings yet another of the field’s values into play: equity, diversity and inclusion in the access and production of information, as well as the representation in the information (this is the focus of the next chapter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nThink of the past chapters in which we discussed the information economy, the attention economy, and misinformation, and consider how those relate to the democratic ideal and the factors we identified necessary to achieve it."

It is thus no surprise that at least a handful of scholars working in these schools or departments have sought to provide some conceptual clarity regarding that word that unites us all. What may be more surprising, however, is that several decades of scholarship and debates have not been successful at achieving a consensus on the definition of information. Still, these conceptual explorations have generated many attempts at such a definition leading us to explore more thoroughly a range of other concepts that are related to it and that have sometimes been used to determine what is (and what is not) information. They have also generated quite an entertaining debate between two scholars, Birger Hjorland, and Marcia Bates, who had very different views on what information was, and what it meant to our field. At the core of their dispute was whether information is to be understood as an objective or subjective phenomenon.\n\n2.2.1.1 The Bates-Hjorland debate\nMarcia Bates believed that all information is natural and exists in the material world of matter and energy and that \"almost anything existing in the universe, that can come into human and other animals' purview, can be experienced as information\" (Bates, 2006, p. 1033). From there, she came up with a glossary of information types:\n\nEmbedded information: information left behind on earth by animals. Includes such things as human created tools, or paths through the woods.\nEncoded information: Natural information that is organized symbolically, linguistically, or is signal based.\nEmbodied information: The corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form.\nExosomatic information: Information that is stored outside of the body.\nExpressed information: The ways in which members of a species communicate including language, scents, calls and gestures.\nKnowledge: Information that has been integrated with other contents of understanding and therefore given meaning.\nRecorded information: Information that has been stored in a durable medium (both communicatory and memorial information). For example, books.\nTrace information: The information that remains after a species is done with it. For example, a no-longer-used wasps' nest.\n\nMany of these definitions are intertwined with each other. For example, all of the knowledge that a person has stored in their memory is encoded in the neural pathways in their brain. The way that life is experienced and remembered is embodied in the degree of consciousness that the person has (Bates, 2006).\nWhile Bates had many definitions for information two of her most debated definitions included information 1 and information 2."

    "section": "2.3 Information: Objective or Subjective?",
    "text": "2.3 Information: Objective or Subjective?\nAccording to Hjørland (2007) There are two basic views of information:\n\nObjective information: information is any difference in patterns of matter and energy\nSubjective/situational information: information is a difference that makes a differnence\n\nLet's look at an example of information 1. Someone waving their hands towards themselves is often culturally construed to mean \"come here\". Although there are situations where someone may not understand this gesture in this way, with Bates' definition it is still considered an objective phenomenon. The movement remains information regardless of whether it is seen or even interpreted (Hjørland, 2007).\nInformation 2 is described as \"some pattern or organization of matter and energy given meaning by a living being\" (Hjørland, 2007, p.1450). The idea that words only have meaning situationally and temporarily coincides with this definition of information but not with information 1. One problem with this definition is that it does not consider how computers also process information not just living beings. Information in computers is not objective because programmers give meaning to the strings of numbers (Hjørland, 2007).\nBirger Hjørland believes that Bates' theory of information is both inadequate and inappropriate for information science. She believes that Bates is trying to have it all by defining information in more than one way. Next let's look at Hjørland's definition of information.\nWhat one person considers information may not be considered information to another person or in another situation. Researchers from different fields will look at the world from different perspectives and will process information through different lenses (Hjørland, 2007).\n\n2.3.1 So, when is information not information?\nIf no one is aware of an object than it cannot be information, it can become information once someone becomes aware of it. Under the situational definition of information, whether or not something is information depends on the circumstances surrounding the document, data, object or event. These things may be defined as information in certain situations but not in others. This idea becomes complicated when you think of how vast the range of information can be, determining if something is informative very difficult. Think of an example of a tree, which can be informative in more than one way. It will represent other trees of its kind, but also the rings inside the trunk provide information about weather patterns. Hjørland states that \"we are unable to say confidently of anything that it could not be information\" (Hjørland, 2007, p. 1451) meaning that everything may well be information.\n\n\n2.3.2 Document\n\n2.3.2.1 Information as a thing\nMichael Buckland describes information in three ways; information-as-thing, information-as-knowledge and information-as-process. Information can be thought of as a thing when it is used to describe an object such as data or documents. They are considered information because they are informative, they impart knowledge or communicate information. Information systems deal directly with information-as-thing; libraries with books, museums with objects.\nWhat then is informative? You can be informed by many different things, in fact pretty much everything around you can be informative including messages, documents objects and events. Brookes (pg. 14, 1979) states that \"the primary source of information is not the literature of the sciences but the observation of the relevant natural phenomena\" (Hjørland, 2007).\n\n\n2.3.2.2 What is a document?\nWith the increase in publications in the late 19th century more techniques were needed to keep track of all of the documents being produced. It was around the early 20th century when the word documentation was adopted to describe this practice. Since then, there has long been a debate around what exactly qualifies as a document. The question is whether the meaning of document should be limited to just texts and printed texts. If the word document can describe a text that is not printed who's to say it can't also describe things that are not texts at all. Throughout the years many different academics have published their ideas on what is and is not a document. In 1934 Paul Otlet wrote in Traité de documentation that \"objects themselves can be regarded as documents if you are informed by observation of them\" (pg. 805). Soon after, in 1935 Walter Schurmeyer stated that a document is any material that is used to extend our knowledge. Similarly, the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation defined a document as \"any source of information, in material form, capable of being used for reference or study or as an authority\" (pg. 805). They include in this definition manuscripts, illustrations and museum specimens among other things (Buckland, 1997).\nSuzanne Briet was involved in the debate for many years, and she defines a document as \"any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon\" (pg. 806). She is well known for her example of an antelope as a document. She discusses how an antelope that is living free in Africa would not be considered a document but once it is captured and put into a zoo it becomes an object of study. At that point it becomes a document as it is now physical evidence used by researchers. Based on this reasoning she describes six objects and determines whether or not they are a document:\nAlthough Briet's rules for determining whether or not an object is a document are not abundantly clear, there are some rules that can be inferred:\n\nA document is physical,\n\n\n\nA document is intentional intentionality; the objects are intended to be treated as evidence.\n\n\n\nThe objects must be processed to be made into documents.\n\n\n\nThe object must be perceived as a document.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 What is an archive?\nArchives have different meanings to different academics (Caswell, 2016). In humanities studies \"the archive denotes a hypothetical wonderland, the first law of what can be said, the system that governs of the appearance of statements as unique events\" (Caswell, 2016, pg. 1?) An archive is historically understood to be passively engaged with the documentation and preservation processes (Fitzgerald et al). Verne Harris does not believe that archives actually reflect reality but only provide a small snapshot of historical events. She states that \"the archival record is but a sliver of social memory (Harris, 2002, Pg. 64). She believes that archives as shaped by the people who create them, the archivists who preserve and make them available and the researchers who use them (Harris, 2002).\nIf information is considered knowledge, then it must be intangible – it cannot be touched or measured (Buckland, 1991).\nInformation as a process occurs when someone is informed of something, changing what they know (Buckland, 1991)."

Indeed, one of the main issue with the word “information” is that it is used in a wide variety of contexts or disciplines, and the meaning of the word often depends on that context or discipline. What then would be the specific understanding of information that are most useful for information management? The figure below is a network showing the links between disciplines represented by a large circle and the most frequent keywords containing the word “information” that research publications in these disciplines contain. our field is represented by the orange circle labeled “LIS” (for Library and Information Science).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of this map?

They have also generated entertaining debates, such as the well-known discussion between Birger Hjørland and Marcia Bates on whether or not an understanding of information as an objective phenomenon is useful for the field. In the next section, we provide an overview of how three scholars of the information disciplines have proposed that we should think about the term information: Marcia Bates, Birger Hjørland, and Michael Buckland (who most of you got acquainted with in week 1 of the organization of information course).\n\n\n2.2.3 Fundamental forms of information\nMarcia Bates believed that all information is natural and exists in the material world of matter and energy and that \"almost anything existing in the universe, that can come into human and other animals' purview, can be experienced as information\" (Bates 2006, 1033). From there, she constructed a glossary of the different forms of information:\n\nEmbedded information: Information left behind on earth by animals. Includes such things as human created tools, or paths through the woods.\nEmbodied information: The corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form.\nEncoded information: Natural information that is organized symbolically, linguistically, or is signal based.\nEnacted information: The pattern of organization of actions of an animal in, and interacting with, is environment, utilizing capabilities and experience from its neural stores.\nExperienced information: The pattern of organization of subjective experience, the feeling of being in life, of an animal.\nExosomatic information: Information that is stored outside of the body.\nExpressed information: The pattern of organization of communicatory scents, calls, gestures, and ultimately, human spoken language used to communicate among members of a species and between species.\nGenetic information: Information contained in the genotype\nGenotype: The genetic constitution of a living thing.\nInformation 1: The pattern of organization of matter and energy\nInformation 2: Some pattern of organization of matter and energy given meaning by a living being.\nKnowledge: Information that has been integrated with other contents of understanding and therefore given meaning.\nNeural-cultural information: Information that has been created by, processed in, or disseminated from animal nervous systems, especially human nervous systems. (Neural information may also be used for lower animals and/or specifically for the nervous system structures that make memory and action possible in general in animals and humans.)\nPhenotype: The genetically and environmentally determined embodiment of a genotype.\nRecorded information: Information that has been stored in a durable medium.\nRepresented information: Natural information that is encoded or embodied.\nTrace information: The information that remains after a species is done with it. For example, a no-longer-used wasps' nest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to read more about the fundamental forms of information and their relevance for the information field according to Marcia Bates, you can read the full article:\nBates, Marcia J. 2006. \"Fundamental Forms of Information.\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 57 (8): 10331045. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20369.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Information: Objective or Subjective?\nAccording to Hjørland (2007) There are two basic views of information:\n\nObjective information: information is any difference (in patterns of matter and energy, as in Bates’ concept of information 1)\nSubjective/situational information: information is a difference that makes a difference\n\nIn his paper, @hjorland_information_2007 criticizes Bates’ fundamental form of information and argues that only subjective information is relevant to the field, and while Bates’ concept of information 2 is compatible with that view, the concept of information 1 is not and, according to Hjørland (2007), should be ignored. Hjørland also argues that Bates’ definition of information 2 is too limited because it does not consider how computers process information, and because the 0s and 1s (the patterns of matter and energy) that computers process are not information in themselves because their interpretation depends on the computer program (what the programmer programmed the strings to represent).\n\n\n2.2.5 So, when is information not information?\nIf no one is aware of an object than it cannot be information, it can become information once someone becomes aware of it. Under the situational definition of information, whether or not something is information depends on the circumstances surrounding the document, data, object or event.

    "text": "2.5 Data, information, knowledge, and wisdom\nThe wisdom hierarchy is an important part of information sciences. The hierarchy (pictured below) is often described in the form of a pyramid with data on the bottom followed by information, knowledge and wisdom. Many authors agree that the first appearance of the hierarchy was in T.S. Elliot’s poem The Rock.\n\n“Where is the wisdom that we have lost in knowledge?\nWhere is the knowledge that we have lost in information?”\n\nThe hierarchy is used to connect wisdom, knowledge, information and data to one another and to identify how entities at the lower levels transform into the higher levels. The assumption is that the lower-level entities can be used to create the higher-level entities. Under this assumption it would follow that data creates information, information creates knowledge and knowledge creates wisdom. There is not full consensus on the meanings of each section of the pyramid, for example, some authors believe that information and knowledge are the same thing. Bellinger believes that understanding should never be a level of the pyramid and instead is what helps the transition between levels (Rowley, 2007).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) pyramid\n\n\nOne of the more well-known researchers of the Wisdom Hierarchy is Ackoff. Ackoff includes the common elements of the hierarchy in his definition along with an extra level which he calls understanding. The following are Ackoff’s definitions of the hierarchy.\n\nData: symbols representing the properties of events, objects and the environment. It is of no use until it is processed into a relevant form. Data tend to be products of information.\nInformation: information is what is inferred from data. It is contained in the answers to the questions beginning with who, what, where, when and how many.\nKnowledge: is know how. It “is what makes possible the transformation of information into instructions” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2006).\nIntelligence: “the ability to increase efficiency” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2007).\nWisdom: “the ability to increase effectiveness” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2007).\n\nAlthough there are some discrepancies in the definitions of the key elements there are some common elements that show up in many of the definitions.\nMost definitions of data are written in terms of what data lacks. They agree that there is no meaning or value to data because it has no context. They also agree that data is unorganized and unprocessed, it is discrete objects, facts or observations. Another common idea is that data is recorded descriptions of things, events, activities, or transactions (Rowley, 2007).\nCommon words to describe information include format, structure, organization, meaning and value. Many definitions describe information in terms of data. A few other common definitions include:\nInformation is:\n\nFormatted data\nData that makes a subject more understandable\nData that has become meaningful and useful to humans\nOrganized data that now has meaning\nData processed for a purpose\n\nKnowledge has many definitions by different researchers, there is not nearly as much consensus on the definition. Barnes stated that “knowledge is information processed in the mind of an individual” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007) whereas Choo states that “information becomes knowledge through the process of belief structuring or the formation of justified, true beliefs about the world” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007). If you were to summarize the most common definitions you would find that knowledge can be viewed as a mix of many things including information, understanding, capability, experience, skills and value.\nMany of the authors within information science believe that they are not capable of defining wisdom (Rowley, 2007)."

Includes such things as human created tools, or paths through the woods.\nEmbodied information: The corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form.\nEncoded information: Natural information that is organized symbolically, linguistically, or is signal based.\nEnacted information: The pattern of organization of actions of an animal in, and interacting with, its environment, utilizing capabilities and experience from its neural stores.\nExperienced information: The pattern of organization of subjective experience, the feeling of being in life, of an animal.\nExosomatic information: Information that is stored outside of the body.\nExpressed information: The pattern of organization of communicatory scents, calls, gestures, and ultimately, human spoken language used to communicate among members of a species and between species.\nGenetic information: Information contained in the genotype\nGenotype: The genetic constitution of a living thing.\nInformation 1: The pattern of organization of matter and energy\nInformation 2: Some pattern of organization of matter and energy given meaning by a living being.\nKnowledge: Information that has been integrated with other contents of understanding and therefore given meaning.\nNeural-cultural information: Information that has been created by, processed in, or disseminated from animal nervous systems, especially human nervous systems. (Neural information may also be used for lower animals and/or specifically for the nervous system structures that make memory and action possible in general in animals and humans.)\nPhenotype: The genetically and environmentally determined embodiment of a genotype.\nRecorded information: Information that has been stored in a durable medium.\nRepresented information: Natural information that is encoded or embodied.\nTrace information: The information that remains after a species is done with it. For example, a no-longer-used wasps’ nest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to read more about the fundamental forms of information and their relevance for the information field according to Marcia Bates, you can read the full article:\nBates, Marcia J. 2006. “Fundamental Forms of Information.” Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 57 (8): 10331045. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20369.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Hjørland: information as a subjective/situation construct?\nAccording to Hjørland (2007) There are two basic views of information:\n\nObjective information: information is any difference (in patterns of matter and energy, as in Bates’ concept of information 1)\nSubjective/situational information: information is a difference that makes a difference\n\nIn his paper, @hjorland_information_2007 criticizes Bates’ fundamental form of information and argues that only subjective information is relevant to the field, and while Bates’ concept of information 2 is compatible with that view, the concept of information 1 is not and, according to Hjørland (2007), should be ignored. Hjørland also argues that Bates’ definition of information 2 is too limited because it does not consider how computers process information, and because the 0s and 1s (the patterns of matter and energy) that computers process are not information in themselves because their interpretation depends on the computer program (what the programmer programmed the strings to represent).\nIf no one is aware of an object than it cannot be information, it can become information once someone becomes aware of it. Under the situational definition of information, whether or not something is information depends on the circumstances surrounding the document, data, object or event. These things may be defined as information in certain situations but not in others. This idea becomes complicated when you think of how vast the range of information can be, determining if something is informative is very difficult. Think of an example of a tree, which can be informative in more than one way. It will represent other trees of its kind, but also the rings inside the trunk provide information about weather patterns. Anything can then be information given the right context. Hence, for Hjørland there is no point in ever considering information as an objective phenomenon without any context, since information is determined and defined by that context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested readings\n\n\n\nIf you want to read more about Hjørland’s view of information and his argument against Bates’ information 1 concept, you can read the full article:\nHjørland, Birger. 2007. “Information: Objective or Subjective/Situational?” Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 58 (10): 1448–56. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20620.\nThis article was followed by a response from Bates followed by another response from Hjørland, if you’re curious to see how this little dispute unfolded.\nBates, M. J. (2008). Hjørland’s critique of bates’ work on defining information. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59(5), 842–844. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20796\nHjørland, B. (2009). The controversy over the concept of “information”: A rejoinder to Professor Bates. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60(3), 643–643. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20972\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Buckland: information as thing, process, and knowledge\nBuckland (1991) describes information in three ways; information-as-thing, information-as-process, and information-as-knowledge.\nInformation can be thought of as a thing when it is used to describe an object such as data or documents. They are considered information because they are informative, they impart knowledge or communicate information. Pretty much everything around you can be informative, which is problematic for information professionals. Indeed, the information systems that we manage deal directly with information-as-thing and since we cannot deal with everything in the world, we need at some point to make decisions as to what kinds of information-as-thing we choose to engage with. The term document may be useful here. According to Briet (1951), a document is “any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon”. She is well known for her example of an antelope as a document. She discusses how an antelope that is living free in Africa would not be considered a document but once it is captured and put into a zoo it becomes an object of study. At that point it becomes a document as it is now physical evidence used by researchers. Information as a process occurs when someone is informed of something, changing what they know, and what is known is information-as-knowledge that exists in an intangible form in the mind of the knowing entity and cannot be observed or measured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nOne branch of our field is called knowledge management. Since knowledge is information in an intangible form, how can it be managed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nTo read more about Buckland’s concepts of information-as-thing, information-as-process, and information-as-knowledge, you can read the full article if you haven’t already:\nBuckland, M. K. (1991). Information as thing. Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 42(5), 351–360. https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199106)42:5%3C351::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-3"

One way to try to make sense of it all is by situating each of these terms in relation to each other. This is one of main contribution of the wisdom hierarchy (pictured below), which is often described in the form of a pyramid with data on the bottom followed by information, knowledge and wisdom.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) pyramid\n\n\nMany authors agree that the first appearance of the hierarchy was in T.S. Elliot’s poem The Rock.\n\n“Where is the wisdom that we have lost in knowledge?\nWhere is the knowledge that we have lost in information?”\n\nThe hierarchy is used to connect wisdom, knowledge, information and data to one another and to identify how entities at the higher levels are created from the entities at lower levels. According to the pyramid, data generates information, information generates knowledge and knowledge generates wisdom. However, just as defining information has proven quite challenging, there is no consensus on the definition of each level of the pyramid, no consensus regarding the number of layers that the pyramid should have, and no consensus regarding the hierarchical nature of the relationship between the concepts. (Rowley 2007).\n\n2.5.0.1 Data\nMost definitions of data are written in terms of what data lacks. They agree that there is no meaning or value to data because it has no context. They also agree that data is unorganized and unprocessed, it is discrete objects, facts or observations. Another common idea is that data is recorded descriptions of things, events, activities, or transactions (Rowley, 2007).\nCommon words to describe information include format, structure, organization, meaning and value. Many definitions describe information in terms of data. A few other common definitions include:\nInformation is:\n\nFormatted data\nData that makes a subject more understandable\nData that has become meaningful and useful to humans\nOrganized data that now has meaning\nData processed for a purpose\n\nKnowledge has many definitions by different researchers, there is not nearly as much consensus on the definition. Barnes stated that “knowledge is information processed in the mind of an individual” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007) whereas Choo states that “information becomes knowledge through the process of belief structuring or the formation of justified, true beliefs about the world” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007). If you were to summarize the most common definitions you would find that knowledge can be viewed as a mix of many things including information, understanding, capability, experience, skills and value."

    "text": "3.2 The information society\nThe information society is a band from the 1980s, but it is also a type of society that succeeds the industrial society and in which information plays a dominant role. Theorists of the information society have focused on five dimensions of the information society (Webster 2014):\nThe technological dimension of the information society is reflected in the growth of information technologies such as personal computers, smartphones, and the internet, which are now ubiquitous. The economic dimension of the information society emphasizes the dominance of information and knowledge industries and the increased share of countries’ GDP they generate. The occupational dimension is demonstrated by the rise of service industries, and highlights that in information societies, the majority of employees are not involved in the production of tangible goods. The spatio-temporal dimension of the information society is centered around networks, digital technologies, and hyper-connectivity that transcend some of the time and space constraints of the physical world. Think, for example, of how information technologies allow you to engage with groups distributed around the globe or attend a live event taking place in Australia or Norway no matter where you are in the world. Think of how in the middle of the night, you can virtually be somewhere where it is the middle of the day. The cultural dimension of the information society points to the role of information in the production and reproduction of culture and individual and collective identities. Finally, the theoretical knowledge dimension emphasizes the rise of evidence-based practice and the centrality of data, information and knowledge as the increasingly dominant drivers of individual and collective action.\nThese dimensions are not independent from one another and are in fact all intertwined, so it can be difficult to consider one without the others. Still, they allow us to consider our world and the kind of problems we are dealing with from different angles, which can help us achieve a more holistic perspective on information and its role in society, and perhaps better solutions to the information problems that we will tackle as information professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nDespite being a little bit dated and not written for an information science audience, the following book (which used to be the foundation of the course) can be a useful resource if you are interested in getting an overview of the main theories of the information societies that have been proposed by scholars over the last 50 years or so.\nWebster, F.

    "section": "3.3 Types of information issues",
    "text": "3.3 Types of information issues\nIn the previous chapter and class, we explored the concept of information. We situated it in relation to dozens of other related concepts, which I hope helped you expand your understanding of how information manifests itself in the different spheres of society. No matter where we look in this complex conceptual landscape, we can find opportunities and challenges for information professionals, or let’s call them “information issues” for us to tackle. I would argue that are three fundamental forms of information issues:\n\nIssues of information access\nIssues of information quantity\nIssues of information quality\nIssues of information behaviour\n\nSome of these will come back in one way or another in the following chapters, so the goal is to provide a high-level overview and introduce some topics we will dive more deeply into later on.\n\n3.3.1 Access issues\nArticle 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”. Also, Article 27.1 is states that “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits”. These two points are closely tied to several of the core values of the field presented in chapter 1, such as stewardship and intellectual freedom. The term participate in Article 27.1 can be related to access in terms of having access to the means of production and dissemination of information (e.g., computer, smartphone, internet).\nDespite being considered a universal human right, there are still many ways in which access to information is limited in the world today. Some of the constraints can be physical when information is recorded on a non-digital medium and stored in a specific location, which may or may not be easily accessed, or when digital information resources are behind a paywall. Access to information is at the core of the mission of libraries that build collections of physical and digital information resources so the communities they serve can access them. This also applies to other settings in which information professionals work; there is often (if not always) an information user, with more or less explicit and clearly defined information needs, and an information professional whose role may be to ensure that the user has access to the information they need to fulfill those information needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nDo you think that all information should be accessible to everyone? If not, what kind of information do you think should not accessible to all? How can you reconcile the notion that some information should not be accessible to all with the idea of information as a human right?\n\n\nAnother critical issue to consider is the inequalities in access to information. Since information is crucial for personal, social and professional development and for people to thrive in the information society, differences in access to information based on socio-demographic factors can contribute to creating or reinforcing existing inequalities. That is one of the reasons why equity, diversity, and inclusion is such an important topic in our field and one that you will find in many of your courses.\nThe unequal access to information is often referred to as the digital divide, defined as “the gap between individuals, households, business and geographic areas at different socioeconomic levels with regard both to their opportunities to access information and communication technologies and to their use of the internet for a wide variety of activities” (OECD, 2001). You can check out the network readiness index (https://networkreadinessindex.org/) to see how countries are doing in terms of making digital infrastructure, connectivity and governance. Even within a single country, demographic factors can have a strong relationship with physical access to information and information technology. Income, age, gender, education and location are all predictors of whether or not people have access to the internet. And varying levels of information literacy may lead members of some social groups not to access information even when it is available (Sparks 2013).\nAccess is also closely linked to the literacy concepts family (information literacy, data literacy, digital literacy, etc.), which is core to the information professions, especially in public and academic librarianship. That is where language and the ability to read and write come in, as one cannot have access to information if it is in a language that they do not understand or if it is in a written format and they don’t know how to read. Similarly, people cannot participate in the information society if they don’t have the basic ability to communicate. Teaching people how to read and write and use information technologies is not typically understood as the role of information professionals. However, public libraries are often used as community centers where such training can occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nIn what ways do you think technologies help solve information access issues?\nIn what ways do you think technologies do not help, or even accentuate, information access issues?\nHow do you think information professionals can play a role in ensuring that technologies effectively increase access to information?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Quantity issues\nThere is a lot of information in the world, and a lot of new information is produced every day (that is, of course, if you subscribe to the notion of information as a thing. Otherwise, we could rephrase this and say that there is a lot of information happening every day). Anyways, the following two quotes can help us grasp just how much information we are talking about.\n\nThe amount of information being created every two days is equivalent to that created from the dawn of civilization until the year 2003 (Benselin and Ragsdell 2016).\n\n\n“A weekly edition of the New York Times contains more information than the average person was likely to come across in a lifetime in seventeenth-century England” (Bawden and Robinson 2009).\n\nLiving in a world of information abundance, it may be difficult to imagine that we could still find ourselves in situations of information scarcity. Isn’t finding the information we need as simple as picking up our smartphones and “googling” whatever we want to know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of a situation in which you found yourself not finding (or having a lot of difficulty finding) the information that you needed? How did you feel? How did you cope with the situation? What was the outcome?\n\n\nYou may think that the general abundance of information is a good thing. After all, isn’t information the basis of all (or most) knowledge and of better “informed” decisions? Can there be too much of a good thing as information?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of a situation in which you found yourself having too much information? What was the context? How did you feel? How did you cope with the situation? What was the outcome?\n\n\nThe idea that there is a point where more information is just too much information is often called information overload. This is by no means a new phenomenon, but as technological developments increase our capacity to produce, disseminate and store information, so does the amount of information that the average human is exposed to and needs (or believes they need) to process or manage. When the amount of information exceeds our capacity for processing and managing it, we are in a situation of information overload (Misra and Stokols 2012). Information overload can cause many negative outcomes, including psychological stress, exhaustion, negative affect, decreased productivity (Matthes et al. 2020), information addiction, distraction, and symptoms similar to attention deficit disorder (Bawden and Robinson 2009).\nThe following video is about how having too much choice leads to poorer decisions or less satisfaction about our decisions, which the speaker calls the “paradox of choice”. I think it also applies to information and that we have, in fact, a “paradox of information”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Quality issues\nAccess to information is great, and access to a lot of information is even better (with some caveats, as we discussed above). However, another fundamental concern with our information society is the quality of the information available to us. Again, if information is the basis of all (or most) knowledge and better “informed” decisions, what happens if the information we receive is inaccurate or simply false? We may use our filtering mechanisms or critical thinking skills and reject that information. In this case, we have wasted some time. But what if we fail to recognize the poor quality of the information we receive and use it as a basis to form an important decision or to shape our worldview?\nThe widespread presence and spread of misinformation (and related concepts such as disinformation and fake news) has been facilitated by the rise of the internet and other information technologies that make the production and dissemination of information accessible to all. Bran et al. (2021) used the term Information pollution or ‘infollution’ to describe the growing problem of the spread of unwanted messages in society in quantity large enough to cause significant affect human and social activities, and consider conspiracy theories, propaganda, memes and memetic warfare, and ideological manipulation as forms of infollution that can result in wasted time, physical and mental health issues and stress or addiction. No matter how one calls it or in what shape or form it presents itself, misinformation is one of the greatest challenges of our age.\nThere are other ways to think about information quality that come short of falling under the “misinformation” label. For example, we may consider that information is of poor quality when it is, for one reason or another, not effective in achieving the desired goal (e.g., to inform, to increase knowledge, to make a decision). It may also be useful to think about information not only in terms of a single information unit (e.g., a news article or a single statement in a text) but also in terms of collections of information units (e.g., a library collection, a set of resources used to support a decision).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of ways in which valid and accurate information may be ineffective at fulfilling an information need or supporting a decision or action?\n\n\nInformation issues can lead to Information anxiety, defined as the state “produced by the ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand. It is the black hole between data and knowledge, and it happens when information doesn’t tell us what we want or need to know” (Naveed 2020, 66). Its symptoms may include the inability to keep up with the information we are presented, frustration over the quality of information available, guilt about not being better informed, or the desire to be the first to know.\n\n\n3.3.4 Behaviour issues\nSo far, we have mainly discussed issues related to the information itself and its accessibility, quantity and quality. However, the last fundamental form of information relates not to the information itself and its characteristics but to how we use it or interact with it: our information behaviour.\nSuppose we side with Hjørland (2007) and consider that only the subjective/situational concept of information is helpful for information professionals. Then we must conclude that all information phenomena that information professionals care about involve humans (or computers) that seek, evaluate, filter, store, organize, produce, disseminate, share, use, or react to information in their own way depending on the context. In that case, the information world we live in (and all its issues of access, quantity, and quality) is the product of individual or group behaviour. However, our information behaviour has effects that transcend the informational world and can positively or negatively affect our individual and collective lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a positive impact on our lives or the lives of others?\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a negative impact on our lives or the lives of others?\n\n\nThe notion of intent is important to consider when thinking about information and the outcomes of our information behaviour. For example, a corporation may intentionally reduce access to information by creating a paywall around highly valuable information. We may produce and disseminate a lot (quantity) of free content (access) with catchy titles but a low informative value (quality) to attract readers and generate ad revenues (intent). A social media user may intentionally post information (true or false) about someone else in order to hurt them. We may intentionally or unintentionally produce or share misinformation. Finally, we may intend to fulfill an information need by gathering a lot of information resources, but we end up causing information overload, analysis paralysis, or anxiety for ourselves or our users or clients."

We can think\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nIn what ways are information technology\n\n\nThe digital divide has been defined as “the gap between individuals, households, business and geographic areas at different socioeconomic levels with regard both to their opportunities to access information and communication technologies and to their use of the internet for a wide variety of activities” (OECD, 2001). The digital divide has existed for a long time and is not going away any time soon. It has been shown through the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) that the digital divide is especially relevant between advanced economies and the rest of the world. This divide is important because it shows that not everyone has the same access to information.\nSkills and access to ICT are required for a lot of different jobs and have become integral to social life. People who do not have access may be socially excluded (Sparks, 2013).\nDemographic factors tend to have a strong influence on technology skills, physical access and how people use these technologies. Income, age, gender, education and location are all predictors of whether or not people have access to internet. Developed countries also have more access as internet connectivity is connected to per capita gross domestic product. There are large differences in the way people use digital technologies, and some social groups choose not to access the information on the internet even when it is available to them (Sparks, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nIn what ways do you think technologies help solve information access issue?\nIn what ways do you think technologies do not help, or even accentuate information access issues?\nHow do you think information professional\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Issue of information quantity\n“the amount of information being created every two days is equivalent to that created from the dawn of civilization until year 2003” (Benselin & Ragsdell, 2016, pg. 285). “A weekly edition of the New York Times contains more information than the average person was likely to come across in a lifetime in seventeenth-century England” (Bawden & Robinson, 2009, p. 184).\nHaving a lot of information available may not immediately appear to be a bad thing. After all, isn’t information the basis of all (or most) knowledge and of better “informed” decisions?\nWhile the main focus of the following TED talk is choices and not information, I would argue that the phenomenon discussed, which the author calls the “paradox of choice” can be applied to information and that what we experience in modern society may be a form of “paradox of information”, where information overload can lead to “analysis paralysis” and a decrease in decision quality (Jacoby 1977).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The idea that there is a point where more information is just too much information is often called information overload. This is by no means a new phenomenon, but has technological development increase our capacity to produce, disseminate and store information, so does the amount of information that the average human is exposed to and needs (or believes they need) to process or manage. When the amount of information exceeds our capacity for processing and managing it, we are in a situation of information overload (Misra & Stokols 2012).\nInformation overload can cause many negative outcomes including psychological stress, exhaustion, negative affect and decreased productivity (Matthes, 2020). Psychological conditions can also result from IO including continuous partial attention; stress caused by needing to be connected at all times and attention deficit trait in which people are distracted and impatient (Bawden & Robinson, 2009).\n\n\n3.4.2 Information quality\nInformation disorders exist and can take on three different forms; misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. Misinformation is defined as “false information that is not intended to cause any harm” (Bran et al., 2021, p. 2). Disinformation is defined as “false information that is intentionally spread in order to cause harm” (Bran et al., 2021, p. 2). Lastly, malinformation is defined as “true information that is manipulated to cause harm” (Bran et al., 2021, p. 2). Information disorders come in many different forms ranging from satire or parody, to fabricated or misleading content, or false context.\nInformation pollution or ‘infollution’ is a growing problem and is defined as “the presence and spread of unwanted messages in human society, in large enough quantities to cause significant negative effects on human and social activities” (Bran et al., 2021, p. 1). Information pollution can take on many different forms including conspiracy theories, propaganda, memes and memetic warfare, and ideological manipulation and can result in wasted time, physical and mental health issues and stress or addiction.\n\n\n3.4.3 Information anxiety\nInformation anxiety has been defined as the state “produced by the ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand. It is the black hole between data and knowledge, and it happens when information doesn’t tell us what we want or need to know” (Naveed, 2020 pg. 66). With the increase in information and communication channels, information has increased in its volume and breadth, creating more information anxiety. There are two main factors that contribute to information anxiety- poor literacy skills and the increased quantity of information. Shedroff (2001) described information anxiety as having many different causes including information overload, lack of understanding, inability to navigate the information landscape, and poorly organized information.\nInformation has been described as having many different forms\n\nThe inability to keep up with the information we are presented\nFrustration over the quality of information available\nGuilt about not being better informed\nThe desire to know things first\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Information literacy\n\n\n3.4.5 Privacy\nInformation as a weapon\nIssues of equity, diversity and inclusion\nIssues of information organization"

    "text": "3.5 Case study\nOver the next nine weeks, we will be following four classmates and friends as they navigate graduate school and work in the information field. These characters will deal with many scenarios in which information affects their day to day lives, giving you a chance to offer the classmates advice, and consider how you might deal with similar situations.\n\n3.5.1 The characters\nWren Reilly (she/her) is a 28-year-old from Collingwood, a small town in Ontario. Wren is an aspiring data manager hoping to work in a position that allows her to work independently and utilize her organizational skills. Wren hopes that her undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Toronto will lend itself well to her future career in data management. She is a logical, individualistic, and introverted individual who works well under pressure. Wren worked for a couple of small new businesses throughout her 20s, helping with programming, and worked in tech support for a larger organization. She plans to work with an organization one day where she can use the knowledge she will gain of databases to deal with big data.\nDante de Luca (he/they) is a 24-year-old from Calgary, Alberta and aspiring public librarian. Dante has an undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Calgary. They considered a career in social work before realizing that public librarianship would allow them to combine their love of helping others with their desire to engage with the community. Dante has always had a passion for libraries. They grew up going to their local library every Saturday with their mom. Throughout high school they volunteered as a reading buddy for younger children and volunteered with newcomers through the English language learning programs at the Calgary Central Library during their undergraduate degree. In the years before deciding to return to school to pursue a graduate degree Dante worked as a front desk administrator at a dog sled tour company in Canmore Alberta. Dante is an extroverted and caring individual who has leadership qualities and aims to one day be the chief executive librarian of a system of libraries.\nJude Jamieson (he/him) is a 31-year-old originally from Cape Breton Nova Scotia. Jude has an undergraduate degree in History from Acadia University. He spent his twenties trying to decide what direction he wants his career to go. He has worn many hats including baker, server and research assistant. Ultimately, he decided that he wanted to pursue further education to work as an archivist. He feels that his love of history and research will suit this profession well. Jude has utilized the archives in the past, working with the archivist at Acadia when he was writing his undergraduate thesis. He loves the idea of organizing and working with the artifacts that make up our past. Jude is an introverted, thoughtful and nostalgic individual and would love to work as a digital archivist.\nTracy Mina Brown (she/they) is a 40-year-old who grew up in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Tracy received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Amsterdam. Before deciding to apply for the MI program Tracy worked as a professional in a non-profit organization, as well as a digital content manager. Her job requires this sort of confident, extroverted, team-player visage, which she does well, but then she needs and really enjoys the quiet and focus of just doing the work alone. She enjoys being highly focused and sees this as a strength. Tracy is pursuing a career in knowledge management, preferably with a non-profit in the arts.\n\n\n3.5.2 Setting\nYou, Wren, Dante, Jude and Tracy have all just started your first year as Master of Information Students at Dalhousie University. You met during the orientation process put on by the university. While sitting on the patio at a pub down by the waterfront you discuss what led each of you to the information profession or back to school.\nYou all sit down and order your food and drinks. You are curious and ask the others: What brought you to the MI program?\nJude: Well, my undergraduate degree was in history and focused on a Nova Scotian context. When I finished my degree I worked as a baker for a few years, but I kept picking up side-projects with the local archives in my town; transcribing documents online, digitizing my family’s cookbooks. After a while, I figured that if this was something I was interested in, I should pursue it as a career!\nDante: That’s so cool how you were able to take your interests and turn them into career passions! For me, I’ve always loved to read, and I’ve dreamed of opening a bookstore and coffee shop for years. I ended up going to school for psychology and business but realized along the way that opening a business wasn’t for me. I talked to a family friend who works as a librarian, and it seemed like the perfect fit honestly. I would still get to work with books and people but without the stress of keeping a business afloat. I just want to make the world a better place and I think libraries can really help make that possible. Creating a space where people of all backgrounds can gather, and where information and knowledge are free is so important! I know that to become a librarian I’ll need the ALA accreditation so that affected my decision to apply to Dalhousie.\nJude: I also thought the ALA accreditation would be great to have as an archivist. Looking over the competencies that are developed through this degree, it seemed that they would all be directly relevant to the skills I would need to be successful in my career.\nWren: I’m really interested in the technology part of the program and my goal is to land a data science position in a tech firm, and then move up to a management role. I have a background in computer science and what attracted me to the program is that it brings together technology, management, information, and people in a way that will be more beneficial for me than the computer science programs which are very focused on technology.\nTracy: I came here after a career in non-profits. I have a fine arts degree and if you’re not a gallery or corporate artist, then you work in non-profits. But I wasn’t really trained formally for dealing with an organization’s challenges. I mean, I can creatively problem solve, which they seem to appreciate, but honestly, just as much fails as often as it works, and I don’t even know why. So, while I really like the non-profit I was with and I think their cause is amazing, I came back to school because I felt like every day I was just winging it. It would be nice to know how things should and can work, rather than hoping they work!\nWren: That’s a good reason to apply to school, Tracy! Say, did our order get put through? I guess they forgot, it’s been like 45 minutes!\nDante: Ya, but look how busy it is here. The servers are run off their feet, I bet their communication is not ideal with this much going on.\nLooking around, they recognize the importance of information flows in this restaurant and in all kinds of businesses. They realize that they have all experienced related issues in their previous careers.\nDante: I totally understand what it’s like to have issues with informational flow. When I worked at a dog sled tour company there was always issues with the communication between the front desk staff and the customers. There was a tight cancellation policy and if it wasn’t understood properly customers would end up paying for tours they couldn’t attend, and boy, did that make them angry! No one wants to feel like they’ve wasted $400!\nWren: Jeez, I bet that caused a lot of headaches for the front desk! What did you think could have been done better to avoid those issues?\nDante: I think if we had had a database and computer system that would keeps track of our client and bookings and sent out automated confirmation emails there would be a lot less room for human error and a better flow of communication! I found that the owners weren’t too open to my suggestions though so I made a point of returning to school so that I could bring my ideas to a new organization!\nJude: Yeah, that’s a really good reason to quit! I used to work as a baker and would often deal with supply chain issues. It wasn’t always communicated to us properly what was and wasn’t available, so it was hard to plan our menu. Customers weren’t always happy when we couldn’t have their favorite baked good available, but we tried our best!\nTracy: People can be really grumpy in the morning before their morning cup and bagel, that’s for sure! When I worked at the non-profit, we spent a lot of time applying for grants and often found that the instructions for what was expected were not clear. This made it so hard to gain the funding we required. Every time I wrote one for our organization, I felt like I was just making this stuff up, as I never really knew what people were working on in our organization, or what projects they wanted to get done. Also, we were all over the place with people in countries around the globe – it was impossible to meet them all let alone know what their ambitions were.\nWren: Wow, I never really thought about all the ways that lack of communication or misunderstandings can really affect how so many businesses are run. I worked on several coding projects during my undergrad, and we had different people working on the same code and sometimes that would be a mess when we didn’t have a shared understanding of the project’s goal, or when people didn’t document their changes properly. That can get very inefficient, and frustrating!\nYou have been sitting back and listening to the conversation between your new classmates. Consider the following questions relating the conversation.\n\n\n3.5.3 Discussion Questions\n\nWhat are 1-2 benefits you think Jude will get out of the MI program?\nWhat 1-2 benefits you think Tracy will get out of the MI program?\nConsider the benefits you provided for each Jude and Tracy. Where they exactly the same? If not, how would you explain the differences?\nLook at the SIM course offerings to propose a set of elective MI courses for Dante – explain your choices.\nWhat are 1 or 2 information problems you have experienced in your life up to now? How did you handle these issues?"

    "text": "3.4 Behaviour issues\nSo far, we have mainly discussed issues related to the information itself and its accessibility, quantity and quality. However, the last fundamental form of information relates not to the information itself and its characteristics but to how we use it or interact with it: our information behaviour.\nSuppose we side with Hjørland (2007) and consider that only the subjective/situational concept of information is useful for information professionals, then we must conclude that all information phenomena that information professionals care about involve humans (or a computers) that seek, evaluate, filter, store, organize, produce, disseminate, share, use, or react to information in their own way depending on the context. Then, the information world that we live in (and all its issues of access, quantity, and quality) is the product of individual or group behaviour. However, our information behaviour has effects that transcend the informational world and that can positively or negatively affect our individual and collective lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a positive impact on our lives or the lives of others?\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a negative impact on our lives or the lives of others?\n\n\nThe notion of intent is important to consider when thinking about information the outcomes of our information behaviour. A corporation may intentionally reduce access to information by creating a paywall around highly valuable information. We may produce and disseminate a lot (quantity) of free content (access) with catchy titles but low informative value (quality) in order to attract readers and generate ad revenues (intent). A social media user may intentionally post information (true or false) about someone else in order to hurt them. We may intentionally or unintentionally produce or share misinformation. We may intend to fulfill an information need by gathering a lot of information resources, but end up causing information overload, analysis paralysis, or anxiety for ourselves or our users or clients."

It may also be how we get to experience and know our own selves. So, who are we?\nPeople have different personalities in different in person situations, so too do people present themselves differently on social media. Technologies, and social media more particularly, provide access to different audiences and different aspects of one’s own personality. When we tweet, or post on Facebook or Instagram, we are communicating with multiple audiences, for which our posts may carry different meanings. Zizi Papacharissi (2012) studied the ways in which people present themselves publicly on Twitter (what she calls networked performances). In her paper, she discusses how social media platforms are a space where people interact with others and fulfill their need for expression and social integration. By engaging with others and by posting information about themselves, users perform one or multiple versions of themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nHow do you think the information technologies that you do or don’t use shape your identity?\nIs there such a thing as an authentic self?"

In fact, as people became more physically mobile, they carried with them their ideas, identities, and cultures, and migration can cause cultural shifts over time in many different ways such as fashion, cooking, speech and music."

Through such technologies as television and virtual reality people feel as though they are familiar with locations they may never see in real life.\nTechnologies such as automobiles and planes have changed the way that we travers physical spaces. People are able to travel distances that in the past would have taken days, weeks or years. You can tell that space has been manipulated in the way that humans talk about trips in terms of minutes instead of distance.\nPeople have been conditioned to expect immediacy. They want to have access to food at any time of the day, to shop even when stores are closed and have their mobile phones with them at all times, always being contactable. These changes have also resulted in what has been called 'proximity politics'. When people are bombarded with news about a place, they have never been to they may begin to feel as though they are experts on the region.\nPeople have a compulsion to proximity; they have an impulse to meet up with people face to face regardless of their virtual relationships. Webster believes that virtual communications and relationships will not replace interpersonal connections. Webster wrote this text in 2014, do you believe that the onset of Covid-19 changed these ideas? Or do you think that people's desires to 'return to normal' align more closely with this idea of compulsion to proximity? (Webster, 2014).\n\n4.5.1 Networked Individualization\nNetworked individualization refers to the fact that people can use technologies to stay in contact with the people in their life, enabling communities to form out of \"networks of interpersonal ties that provide sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging and social identity to the individual\" (Webster 7, pg. 143).\nTo help think about this, we can think of three ways in which humans are connected to one another. Door-to-door connectivity occurs when people live, work and play in one place. Their connections are with their immediate neighbors. Place-to-place connectivity is when people are connected through travelling and gathering together in a network of places. Person-to-person connectivity is placeless and consists of relationships mediated through information technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nThink of different communities or social networks that you belong to.\n\n\n\nNetworked individualization is not just about people connecting to people.

The informatic person lives within the informatic context which is the technological, economic and social networks. The informatic person experiences and influences the informatic context through data interfaces, data circulation, and data abstraction.\nData interfaces “are those systems, devices, infrastructures and objects that connect (individuals or collectives) to broader assemblages of data” (Lee 2021, 173). Your smartphone, smart watch, tablet, television, computer, and the specific sites or apps that you use (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, TikTok) are all data interfaces through which us humans experience the world. Data interfaces are also extractive as they are used by other entities on the network to extract data from you or about you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nThe examples above are all digital platforms or technologies. But not all data that exists is in a digital form. Can you think of other kinds of data interface that are not digital?\n\n\nData circulation refers to the dynamics of data mobility (and immobility); how data is created, moved, stored, shared and repurposed. Humans (but also other entities like machines, companies, and governments) all circulate data, and in fact, almost everything we do can be understood as a form of data circulation.\nData abstraction describes the many ways that data manipulation techniques are used by machines or humans and produce some sort of outcome (intended or not) (Lee 2021). It is essentially the raison d’être of data interfaces and data circulation. Here’s an example: through our smartphone (interface) Google Maps collects data about the current traffic conditions (data circulation) and updates directions to make routes quicker and more efficient.\nLiving in the informatic context are informatic persons who navigate their existence through and with data (Lee 2021). Our informatic personhood is not separated from our physical, biological selves. People develop physical injuries from texting on their smartphone, typing on keyboards, or looking at screens. The informatic context also changes our brains, as humans develop neuro-physical mechanisms to handle things such as information overload and the data interfaces that constantly seek your attention. The informatic context can actually change our attention spans and ability to concentrate (Lee 2021)."

    "text": "4.3 Networks, standards and marginality\nNetworks are all around us (e.g., phones, computers, road systems, the post) and many of these networks become stabilized and standardized over time. We can think of these networks as the informatic contexts within which we live our informatic personhood. We access the networks through data interfaces and then circulate data on the networks which generate some outcomes. This section is about the standardizing forces of networks that constrain the ways in which we can access them and the things we can do on them. Indeed, every network is characterized by a more or less stable set of norms and standards, some of which can be extremely difficult to change once the network is stabilized. For example, choosing the color red for stoplights was an arbitrary choice initially but has become so universal that it is no longer a choice.\nNetworks are also not neutral. They are populated with actors or groups that have more influence or power than others and are thus able to influence the structure of the networks, how they operate, and what their norms and standards come to be. Those who happen to fit the standards are able to navigate the network with some ease, but others those who do not fit the standards can find themselves marginalized and excluded. Since there is always a gap between the standards of social or technological networks and the needs of the individuals that live inside (or outside) of them, we can think of the marginalization of actors on the network s a continuum: everyone is marginalized to some degree. Susan Leigh Star (1990) discusses the problem of standardization through an analogy. They are allergic to onions, and observed that their order for a burger with no onions at McDonalds would take a very long time to be prepared. They realized that because the standard process of preparing a burger at McDonalds includes onions, going against this standard “breaks the system”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggesting reading\n\n\n\nThis short post about life without a smartphone illustrates some of the points Star (1990) made long before smartphones even existed:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/04/my-life-without-a-smartphone-is-getting-harder-and-harder"

Tracy and Jude spent the summer working in the city while Dante and Wren have just returned from a month of travelling. They went on a road trip around Nova Scotia exploring seaside towns and enjoying many beach days. You have been keeping up with their frequent social media updates on their accounts: ’Throw_a_Wren-ch_in_it” and “All_you’ve_ever_Dante-d” where they post updates and pictures of their adventures. You notice that Jude and Tracy’s online activity and social media content differs from Wren and Dante’s. You consider your own information networks and how you exist as an informatic person.\n\nYou: Good to see you Dante, Wren! Wow, you both look like summer has treated you well!\nWren: Hey strangers! You just wouldn’t believe this past month- pure bliss. Once I graduate, I’m living on the beach full time, just try and stop me!\nDante: Says the person who complained about the Atlantic Ocean being too cold the entire month of August.\nWren: At least I’m not so afraid of sharks I won’t even go in the water past my ankles. Say, do you follow that great white shark tracker online? Everyone is tweeting about their geographic locations around Nova Scotia beaches and panicking. I feel like they get a bad rap.\nTracy: Oh yes, I do follow that! I feel like it’s a nice way to see a global network of such an amazing creature. I think widespread panic regarding something like sharks is unavoidable in a large online setting like Twitter… besides, don’t you think social media and being online distorts the way we view anything?\n\nDante: What do you mean?\nTracy: Well, I guess we can all be interpreted differently online depending on how we exist and interact in our networks. Take your accounts, for example. You and Wren aren’t a part of the beach brigade all year round, you know? All Wren has been posting about lately is lobster rolls and lifeguards she finds dreamy. If you didn’t personally know her, would you be surprised to learn she is working towards a career in data management?!\nWren: But… that is me! I’m behind the screen posting those things! Are you saying I’m not as adventurous and fun in person as I look online? Also, data is fun!\nTracy: I think you are even more so, friend! But we all curate ourselves and engage differently online, right? Like, I don’t share pics of my kid, for example. That’s just too personal for me.\nJude: I agree with Tracy. I have a co-worker who posts his original poetry on his social media. It comes across totally innocent; at work he is such a nice guy! We found out the other day that he has been writing about the new interns and sending his poems to them on their personal social media accounts! Let’s just say he’s getting reviewed this week…\n\nDante: Well, I wrote and posted many a song on my guitar as Wren and I gallivanted across our glorious province this summer, and all of them were simply odes to my love of Mother Nature. No harm in that!\nWren: Not all true! Remember when you wrote that cheesy song for your boyfriend’s birthday and accidentally posted it on your public social media?!\nDante: Oh, right! Only my mom ended up watching it before I took it down, but I wouldn’t really mind if others had listened to it. I express myself more freely online.\nJude: I’ve got to hear this song! I do too, Dante. I feel more comfortable sharing my views on various social justice issues on my blog than I do talking about my opinions in class. I feel more confident online, almost like I can be a different person behind the screen. I also just feel like I have more tools and information at my disposal to connect my thoughts and make more informed arguments!\nWren: You are so tactful and thoughtful about your online activism though, Jude. Unlike that one politician who blasts people on Twitter all the time. That has really been detrimental to his professional life.\nDante: Yeah, like that dude I know who got fired because of the insensitive things he was posting on his Facebook.\nTracy: That’s exactly what I’m afraid of! I’ve had some platforms for so long that at this point I have a huge mix of professional colleagues, friends, and family involved in my networks, so I have to engage very thoughtfully online. I do enjoy connecting my various worlds and communities and wish I felt freer to share different types of content, but my content seems to be increasingly restrained. I’m down to recipes now, for the most part.\nWren: Well, I still stand by the fact that Wren in real life is the same person who has reviewed 30 different versions of lobster rolls, with a side of lifeguards. I think that’s rather impressive data collection, considering I was on vacation…\nYou realize you have been scrolling through your phone for the past 10 minutes, considering how you engage online. You are connected with Dante, Wren, Jude, and Tracy on social media and other online networks (e.g. online learning software, social platforms, professional development sites, digital correspondence).\nYou continue contemplating the topics that have come up in your conversation. Consider how you exist in your information networks, in a mobile society, and your own informatic personhood.\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nIn what ways might Wren’s online persona be authentic? In what ways might it be curated?  \nHow do you feel about workplaces punishing people for the content on their personal social media channels?\nDo you think it’s ok for companies to look at personal social media accounts in the hiring process?\nDo you believe companies have the right to monitor the activities of their employees in a personal setting? Would you consider social media and online platforms a private or public environment?\nWhat are 3-4 different online communities you are a part of (school, family, friends, work, etc.)? Consider how you establish and situate yourself in your networks.\nWhat information do you share online? Does this change based on the online space you are in?\nConsider 1-2 ways in which technology facilitates or inhibits your ability to interact in your in-person and online networks. How do you act as a bridge between various worlds?\nConsider the differences (or similarities) in how you interact with friends, professional colleagues, or other groups online versus in person. In what ways do you engage with them differently online than you do face to face? Do you feel you take on a different persona? What benefits or detriments do you perceive as a result of this difference?"

    "text": "5.2 Introduction\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, the occupational dimensions of the information society emphasize the increase in informational work: jobs are increasingly about producing, gathering, evaluating, sharing, publishing, processing, recording, storing, organizing, or managing data and information. Of course, some jobs may be more information focused (e.g., a librarian, a data scientist) than others (a police officer, or a manager) but most people are engaged in some degree of informational labour at work. As information professionals, we may seek to understand how information shapes the working lives of individuals, the information issues that they deal with at work, and how they can be addressed.\n\n5.2.1 Information needs\nWorking tends to involve the production of some outcome, which implies (ideally) having some knowledge of what to do, knowledge of how to do it and making some decisions based (ideally) on that knowledge. The thing about knowledge is that it is never complete, and we almost always operate under a degree of uncertainty. In other words, there are often gaps between what we know and what we should know to perform our work optimally or make the best possible decision or action in a given situation. Circling back to the pyramid, we can think of those conscious knowledge gaps as conscious or unconscious data and information needs that individuals have, and that can only be understood in relation to the context Borlund and Pharo (2019). As we read about the workplace as an information setting, consider the purpose and context of individuals in the workplace and how that might determine their specific information needs."

Presence on social media is today a must for many organizations but often with little solid evidence on what strategies work and which do not. Responsibility for decision making is also becoming increasingly decentralized and moving employees closer to customer. This change has led to a higher independence and responsibility for the individual employee, including responsibility for managing personal learning processes, allocation of time and focusing attention. As personal responsibility increases, personal information management is also becoming increasingly important, since swift access to relevant information often depends on structuring and managing information relevant to various work tasks.” (Byström, Heinström, and Ruthven 2019)"

    "text": "5.5 Workplace and information overload\nInformation overload (IO) is not a new phenomenon but has been growing steadily in prominence during the nineteenth century with the expansion of publication and then exponentially with the onset of the internet (Bawden & Robinson, 2009). As discussed in Chapter 3, information overload occurs when the amount of information someone is encountering outweighs their ability to manage it (Misra & Stokols 2012). Information overload can cause many negative outcomes including psychological stress, exhaustion, and decreased productivity (Matthes, 2020). Psychological conditions can also result from IO including continuous partial attention; stress caused by needing to be connected at all times and attention deficit trait in which people are distracted and impatient (Bawden & Robinson, 2009). IO can also lead to decision paralysis or make it hard for people to make adequate decisions (Benselin & Ragsdell, 2016).\nAs technology and instant messaging become larger aspects of various workplaces, the ability to send and receive more information in the workplace grows. Workers are often bombarded with information past the point of their ability to manage it. Many organizations send out mass e-mails to their workforce constantly, or may otherwise inundate workers with news, training, best practices, or other information. As more e-mails are sent at work, their individually perceived importance wanes, and the workers' ability to prioritize and process the information within these messages becomes compromised.\nAt the workplace, information explosion is shown in a rising email volume, which indicates the relevance of information technologies for IO. According to a representative study, in 2019, 293.6 billion emails were received and sent per day, and by 2023, this figure is expected to rise to 347.3 billion emails (The Radicati Group, 2019). In addition to the amount of information, managers associate IO with the lack of time to understand and process information and the lack of relevance of the information for processing a task (Farhoomand & Drury, 2002). Thus, information overload might be associated with both quantitative and qualitative information characteristics (Graf & Antoni, 2021). As workers deal with more and more information, needs and expectations must be mitigated to prevent IO and its related negative effects."

As the lines between home and workplace blur, so can the lines of work and home life. The balance between these facets of our lives is known as work-life balance (WLB). If an individual is not able to separate these facets in a healthy way, they are likely to experience stress and other issues related to this imbalance that can be referred to as work-life conflict (WLC), which according to Health Canada happens when timing and scheduling that can lead to conflicts, and when individuals feel overwhelmed, overloaded or stressed by the pressures of multiple roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nHow do you think work-life conflicts can be understood as an information issue?\nHave you experienced challenges with work-life balance?\nWhat information factors have created positive experiences with the workplace, what situations have led to negative ones?"

As workplaces change, we have seen how information overload and work-life conflicts can create and exacerbate information issues. When we seek information management solutions for these and other workplace problems, we can strive for ideals such as transparency, empowerment, and equality.\nBusiness Process Models (BPMs) are a tool that can help workers and managers visualize the flow of different processes related to their work – these tools can also help us visualize the information needs of the individuals at each step of the process. As different individuals and departments may come together to complete a task, so too will the information needed to complete that task. By creating accurate BPMs, organizations can help create transparency for workers that allow information needs to be better identified and met. By working directly with employees and their feedback, these processes can be streamlined to benefit customers, managers, and workers alike. \n While some tools can be used to empower workers and meet their information needs, information management tools can also be used to inhibit those same needs. As we consider software tools for database management, knowledge management and employee communications, it is important to consider what other workplace expectations could be enforced by these systems.

In addition to profanities, however, the terms include many relevant to organized labor, including “union,” “grievance,” “payraise,” and “compensation.” Other banned keywords include terms like “ethics,”, “unfair,” “slave,” “master,” “freedom,” “diversity,” “injustice,” and”fairness.” Even some phrases like “This is concerning” will be banned.

They have each completed a unique practicum in the spring/summer.\nDante worked at the North Memorial Public Library in Halifax, Jude worked at the LGBTQ community archives, Tracy worked for a non-profit arts collective creating taxonomies, and Wren worked at a tech start-up.\nYou run into Tracy and Dante in the common room on campus after you finish class one afternoon. They have been engaged in a conversation about their practicums and are discussing some of the issues that came up in their short time at their respective organizations.\nDante: I know I’ve wanted to work in a public library for a while now, but the reality was definitely different from what I had imagined.\nTracy: How so?\nDante: Well, there was a lot of bureaucracy involved. It was often hard to get things done because we had to get approval from so many different staff members before we could actually go ahead with the programming we were planning. This was especially true when we were trying to create programs involving 3D printers. The financial cost was high so upper management wanted to be more involved.\nTracy: I can see how that would be frustrating! I noticed a lot of inefficiencies at my placement as well. People were always complaining about the number of emails they receive often with information that wasn’t relevant to them or was repetitive.\nDante: That is so valid. We dealt with the opposite. There was a distinct lack of communication and I felt like I wasn’t getting the information I needed to do the job I was hired on for. I know I was essentially an unpaid intern, but I would’ve liked a bit more direction.\nTracy: Or commitment from the organization, right? I found that I was expected to do a lot more than was feasible. I also found that the organization I worked at really had a lack of boundaries. So many people were wanting my attention and help, they would even email me in my off hours or the weekend! Seriously, I think I worked through every weekend just trying to keep up! Not only did I not know how to do things, but I had to seek out training or tutorials on my own that the organization did not have.\nDante: Yes, these are all such frustrating situations that could be avoided! I’m really excited to run my own library branch some day and work to fix these information flows.\nTracy: I agree! I hope that one of the benefits of being in an information management position is the ability to work through these informational issues and try to correct them.\nYou realize that Wren had snuck into the common room a few minutes ago.\nWren: This is all so interesting, but you know what it makes me think about? How information is everywhere, and all jobs are centered around information. My dad is a retired dentist and he had to know so much information about all his patients. He had to refer to their charts to see when they had last had a checkup or check their x-rays for information on the health of their teeth and gums. Isn’t all of that an information process, after all?\nYou have been quietly observing the conversation between your classmates. You start to wonder about what issues with information flows you have come across in your past work experience or even in school and how you might address them now as a student in information management. Tracy and Dante turn to you and ask you your advice.\n\n5.8.1 Discussion Questions:\n\nWhat do you think Dante could have done to make the information flows at the library more efficient? Do you think he can elicit change as a new employee?\nDo you think it was fair of Tracy’s employers to ask so much of her in a short-term position? What could she have done or how could she have communicated that she sensed an overload of information?\nDo you feel that the information flow at your last job or school were efficient? How do you feel it was compared to Dalhousie?\nWhat would you do to improve that flow and increase efficiency?\nDo you sometimes feel like you have too much information in your professional life? If so, how do you cope with this information overload?"

There are many theoretical frameworks as to how organizations function and flourish, but we will focus on frameworks that discuss how organizations interact with information in order to meet their goals.\nThere are a variety of types of organizations, which may have different needs and structures, including:\n\nGovernment\nNGOs (Non-Government organizations, generally non-profits or charities)\nCorporations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nHow do these organizations differ? Consider their goals and their composition.\nHow might their information needs be similar or different?"

    "text": "6.3 The Learning Organization\nBusiness Management scholar Peter Senge developed the idea of the learning organization. He envisioned organizations that excelled in the face of rapid change through adaptability and informed decision making. He wrote that learning organizations are “…organizations where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning to see the whole together” (Senge 2006).\nSenge’s concept was influenced heavily by systems theory. Systems theory is an interdisciplinary term that explores how groups, systems, or individuals may interact together in a larger system. Broadly speaking, it can be described as how things can be greater than the sum of their parts. Senge explored his concept of learning organizations in relation to the systems theory of organizations – which seeks to describe and explain how the organization works as a whole to accomplish its goals. Senge wrote a framework of core principles for the learning organization, including the concept he called team learning. Senge describes team learning as a skill in which individuals within the organization can discuss and have dialogue with each other in order for the organization as a whole to learn and advance.\nIf you would like to know more about the systems theory of organizations, consider watching this youtube video (not mandatory, only if you are curious or confused): Systems Theory of Organizations"

    "section": "6.4 The Knowing Organization",
    "text": "6.4 The Knowing Organization\nWe can think of organizations from an information-based view in which the people in organizations are working with information to accomplish specific outcomes. Information Management scholar Chun Wei Choo created a framework in which these outcomes can be divided into three different categories; sense making, knowledge creation and decision making.\n\n6.4.1 Sense making\nThe act of sense making begins when there are changes in the environment which the organization must make sense of. The organization must balance the different interpretations of the messages and cues that arise from the changes.\nThere are four processes that an organization uses to make sense of its environment:\n\nEcological change. The beginning of sense making in which a change or difference in the organizational environment results in a disturbance.\nEnactment. the ways in which people construct the information. People construct the information in two ways. First, they selectively bracket, highlight or isolate the information by only paying attention to certain aspects of the information and ignoring others. Second, they create new features that help them to better understand the environment. After enactment finishes, the organization is left with a smaller set of information.\nSelection. People look at what information has been enacted and try to extract meaning from it. Interpretations that best fit with past understandings are selected .\nRetention. The information is retained for use in the future.\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Knowledge Creation\nOrganizations must continuously create knowledge. Knowledge can be created by managing the relationship between explicit and tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is described as “personal knowledge that is hard to formalize or communicate to others” (Choo 2005). These are such things as subjective know-hows and insights. Explicit knowledge is the opposite, it is formal knowledge that can easily be transmitted between both individuals and groups. Examples of this include formulas and instructions.\nThere are four different ways in which new knowledge can be created:\n\nSocialization. Acquisition of knowledge through the sharing of experiences.\nExternalization. Using abstractions, metaphors, analogies or models to convert tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.\nCombination. Combining explicit knowledge from different sources such as phone calls and meetings to create more explicit knowledge.\nInternalization. Internalization happens when individuals within the organization are able to take tacit knowledge and use it for their own purposes, such as identifying information that is relevant to their specific work or tasks and using it.\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Decision Making\nWhen making decisions an individual is constrained by many different factors including their cognitive and mental capacities, the knowledge they already possess, and their values. The organization is able to control their members through the decision premises that decisions are made on, not on the actual decisions. There are two types of decision premises; value premises and factual premises. Value premises allows someone to figure out what is valuable about an alternative to help make the best possible decision. Factual premises helps the decision maker to determine what information is factual and relevant to the decision that needs to be made (Choo 2005).\n\n\n6.4.4 The Organizational Knowing Cycle\nChoo describes an organization’s flow from one “mode” to another as the Organizational Knowing Cycle.\n“In the knowing cycle, a continuous flow of information is maintained between sensemaking, knowledge creating, and decision making, so that the outcome of information use in one mode provides the elaborated context and the expanded resources for information use in the other modes.” (Wei Choo 2001)\n\n\n\n\n\nChoo comments that learning organizations will encourage and foster innovation through this cycle. Innovations and new concepts are created and then evaluated based on the organization’s needs and goals. Concepts which have been created are then tested and re-evaluated before being enacted in other levels of the organization to generate new cycles of knowledge creation.\n\n\n6.4.5 Business Process Models\nAs we consider ways in which organizations can be learning and knowing, we can look at different tools that can help with sense-making, knowledge creation, and decision making. One such tool is the Business Process Model.\nBusiness Process Models (BPMs) are a tool that people within the organization can use to visualize the flow of different processes – these tools can also help us visualize the information needs of the organization and individuals at each step of the process. As different individuals and departments in an organization may come together to complete a task, so too will the information needed to complete that task. By creating accurate BPMs, organizations can help create transparency for workers that allow information needs to be better identified and met.\nBPMs will be discussed more in your Information Systems class, but we can develop a surface understanding of them in order to think of their usefulness in organizations. Each BPM will have a start point (where the process begins) and an end point (where the process is complete) and may describe different steps in a process for each individual involved. The steps for different individuals may be visually represented in different “lanes,” like in the below BPM for a restaurant process. The customer, host/hostess, waitstaff, chefs, and even the point of sales system are displayed in their own lane. Each lane outlines steps of how and when an individual will participate in the entire process.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: (Somphanpae and Boonsiri 2016)\nBy examining each step of the process, we can anticipate what sort of decisions individuals will have to make during their steps and seek to ensure they have the information that they need. By ensuring that individuals are equipped with the information they need to complete their steps, we can help to ensure that the organization is able to carry out the desired process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\nAt what point in Choo’s model could a BPM be helpful for the organization – sense-making, knowledge creation, or decision-making?"

    "section": "6.5 Embedded Librarianship",
    "text": "6.5 Embedded Librarianship\nPeople tend to identify librarians based on the buildings they work in, thinking that “a librarian works in a library”. This is not always the case. As traditional reference services are becoming less common due to the rise of the internet and the changing role of libraries, librarians are moving out of physical libraries. Embedded librarianship occurs when librarians are embedded within organizations and institutions. These librarians develop strong relationships with the groups of people they work with such as faculty, students, a marketing department or a research team. Embedded librarians are knowledgeable on the work their team is working on (Shumaker 2012b). “In order for librarians to be effective in the learning community, they must be viewed by all as a partner in the community. Real familiarity with the course and content is vital to change the perception of students that the librarian is ‘just visiting’ and is not an integral part of the learning community” (Muir and Heller-Ross 2010, 92)\nThere are three main factors that define embedded librarianship and they include ongoing relationships, knowledge of and commitment to shared goals, and customized high value contributions (Shumaker 2012b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.1 Advantages of Embedded Librarianship\nEmbedded librarians are able to anticipate their patrons needs, they don’t wait to be asked for help. They work for an entire team and help multiple people at once. Embedded librarians understand the needs of their team because they are so familiar with the project. “With embedded librarianship, transactions still occur- documents are requested, instructional sessions are held, or documents are added to a shared virtual workspace- but the emphases shifts from the transaction to the project” (Shumaker 2012a, 13). Embedded librarianships are responsible for more than just providing a service.\n\n\n6.5.2 Other Kinds of Mobile Librarianship\nIt is not only embedded librarians that move outside of traditional library spaces. The following are a few different kinds of librarians you may find outside of the library. (Shumaker 2012a)\n\nVirtual librarians. Virtual librarians are available remotely (sometimes 24/7 due to time zones) through phone, email, instant messaging or texting. These librarians are similar to traditional librarians in that they are passively waiting to be asked for help.\nRoving librarian. A librarian that sets up in different locations such as the classroom, or cafeteria. This librarian is different from embedded as they are still disconnected from the work the organization does, but are there to answer questions.\nPersonal librarian. First year undergraduate students are each assigned their own personal librarian that they can go to for research help throughout their degree. This doesn’t work so well with how many group projects are assigned in universities these days as each student would have a different librarian.\nConsulting librarian. Consulting librarians work with either a team or an individual client. They establish long term relationships and are always planning for the next project. The only drawback is that they aren’t always seen as part of the team."

    "text": "6.6 Case study\nWren and Tracey are out for a walk at Point Pleasant on a sunny Saturday morning in October. Last spring the gang graduated from the MI program and have not seen each other since. The two are very excited to catch up and find out how everything has been going for the last few months.\nWren: Tracy! It feels like forever since I’ve seen you, it’s so good to finally catch up!\nTracy: It does feel like it’s been ages, but time really does fly. Hey! Have you heard what Jude and Dante have been up to this summer?\nWren: Yes- I actually grabbed dinner with them a couple weeks ago when they were visiting Halifax. Dante got an entry level position at South Shore Public Libraries and moved out to Lunenburg, and Jude has been working as a digital archivist at a professional organization in Quebec City.\nTracy: That’s awesome, it seems like they got just the sort of jobs they were looking for. How have you been?\nWren: I’ve been so busy! I was offered a full-time position with the tech start-up that I did my practicum at starting right after we graduated, and it’s been going well. At my firm, we develop solutions for business to collect data from their environment and analyze it to monitor their performance and inform decisions. Our software has modules designed for different teams at various levels of the organization. I feel like the Information Management program really prepared me for this because I’m part of the bridge team that works with both the clients to understand their needs and the software development team. What about you?\nTracy: I have been doing consultant work. It can be quite intense though; it seems we move from one housefire to another. We mostly work with small businesses, especially those that are NGO’s or non-profits. But their infrastructure can be…messy. It is good, challenging work. I feel like I’m contributing to something good at the end of the day, you know?\nWren: It sounds like this job has the potential to be quite satisfying and fulfilling for you!\nAs they’re walking and talking Wren receives a notification on her phone. Opening her email, she finds out that the small company she works for has been bought out by a large corporate organization.\nWren: Oh, wow. That was an email from my boss to everyone in the office. Apparently, our company has just been acquired by a large organization! Good grief!\nTracy: That will be a big change. I dealt with a similar situation at a job I had in my late twenties. The company I was working for was bought out by a corporation and everyone was really worried about how the transition would go.\nWren: Were people ok with the changes that came about?\nTracy: It was a big challenge at first. It took some time, but eventually we ended up better off. I’m still connected with some of my old coworkers on LinkedIn and they’ve told me how happy they are with how the company culture has developed. In my past work I’ve also helped organizations determine their information needs and implement processes that address and meet them. But I agree with you – change is uncomfortable. There will be plenty of people at both companies that are feeling uncertain about the effects of the change. Do you know this new company?\nWren: I looked at jobs with them when I graduated, but they’re too big for me. I didn’t want to go full on corporate – no offence. I wanted someplace small where I could learn and see the impact of my work. Now, being absorbed by a corporate organization… I worry that it may get too bureaucratic and inhibit our efficiency.\nTracy: Yeah, no offence taken – I get it. And I totally agree about small businesses – you get to learn a lot about how they work. Trust me, they will want you to be a part of this. Especially since you understand the culture of your workplace. You can help new employees understand what is important to your team and make this work. What does communication look like in your current workplace?\nWren: Since we’re a small team, communication largely happens in person, by email, and mostly on our shared whiteboard. It’s all a very fast paced environment with changes happening quickly. No one is really in charge, its mostly a collaborative team.\nTracy: Ah, I see. You guys do software… so the environment needs to be quite agile?\nWren: Exactly! We move fast, minimize formal communication, and basically, just get stuff done! Now I feel like we’ll have many new external stakeholders to answer to, potentially delaying our ability to execute quickly. Our company used to decide on its own internal objectives, and now we will be tasked with answering to larger-scale goals and external determinants of value. Before we were happy to place user-centered design at the forefront of our company goals and our small successes were based on integrating customer feedback, but now at a corporate level, I’m not sure what benchmarks of success we will have to meet.\nTracy: Yeah….so change management is going to be critical here. There’s going to be some conflicts of work culture and communication methods. I hope they have someone that’s done this before.\nWren: Well, I feel like I know the company quite well; I’m not sure a larger company that is seeking to incorporate automated knowledge management software really appreciates the human perspective I bring to the table.\nTracy: I can understand why you might feel this way, it doesn’t feel great to have to constantly defend the importance of your role and the value you add to the information processes of your organization.\nWren: Yes, exactly, Tracy. In a smaller workplace environment, it was clear to see how employees were contributing with the work they did and to what degrees. Now, I might be tasked with writing multiple reports a year outlining how my position is critical to the success of the company.\nTracy: I’m sorry, Wren. If it makes you feel better, your friendship is invaluable to me and the rest of the gang. You are a fantastic communicator, though, so I think as long as you exercise those skills during this transitory period, everything will work out okay. Growing pains!\nConsider the exchange of information and knowledge in the workplaces you have worked in and professional environments you have been a part of. Reflect on the importance of communication and how it impacts the success of an organization’s goals.\n\n6.6.1 Discussion Questions\n\nWhat do you think Wren’s company should do to ensure that there is a smooth transition with the merger? How can they ensure that the information flow stays efficient?\nConsider your current or past places of work- how does information flow internally? How does it flow externally?\nDo you find it easier to communicate in smaller team environments versus larger ones? How do communication processes change based on the size of the group? How are our environments influenced based on information processes?\nThink about how these organizations fit into society in a larger context; what role do they play in facilitating communication and information flow on a societal level?\nConsider the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom pyramid. Does it seem relevant to the organizations you have worked in? How could you reimagine it based on the flow of information and exchange of knowledge in the organizations you have been a part of?\nDo you think there is a difference in how non-profit or government funded organisations share knowledge internally compared with for-profit"

    "section": "7.3 The case academic publishing industry",
    "text": "7.3 The case academic publishing industry\nAcademic publishing is an extremely profitable industry. Here’s how it works in a nutshell. Universities (funded mainly by students and taxpayers) pay the researchers’ salaries. The researchers ask for more public money to fund their research and hire research assistants, PhDs and postdocs to do research and write a manuscript to report the research and its results. They then submit the findings to a journal that is managed by a editorial board (all volunteers). One of these volunteers (although there are exceptions, as some editors-in-chiefs are paid) will recruit two or three additional volunteers to evaluate the submitted manuscript. After usually two rounds of reviews, the paper will be copy-edited, packaged, and sold back to the universities who already paid the salaries of all the people involved in the production and evaluation of the work.\nFor a much more detailed and accurate depiction of the industry, consider the suggested reading below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested readings\n\n\n\nThe following article is a very compelling account of the publishing industry and how it came to be.\nBuranyi, S. (2017). Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science? The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science\nThis one is a bibliometric account of how the digital era led to an increased concentration of the publishing market in the hand of a few publishers.\nLarivière, V., Haustein, S., & Mongeon, P. (2015). The Oligopoly of Academic Publishers in the Digital Era. PLoS ONE, 10(6), e0127502. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127502\n\n\nIn principle published research article is unique: “each journal has the monopoly on the scientific content of papers it publishes: paper A published in journal Y is not an alternative to paper B published in journal Z” (Larivière, Haustein, and Mongeon 2015). Furthermore, access to published research is crucial for researchers to stay up to date with the advances in their field and compete in a highly competitive research environment. This allows publishers to increase their prices without influencing demand much, leading to hyperinflation of journal subscription prices that deplete academic libraries budgets (Shu et al. 2017).\nThe digitization of academic publishing and journals created an opportunity to reduce the cost associated with the publication and storage of scholarly journals. The publishers introduced the journal bundles (the “Big Deal”), which indeed seemed like good deals until the continuous price increase of these bundles led libraries back to scare one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of access to scholarly journals in Canada\n\n\n\nThe subscriptions fees paid by Canadian university libraries to some publishers are reported yearly and are openly available. The latest release of this data can be found in Brin (2021). Here are the subscriptions reported for Dalhousie University for the 2019-2020 fiscal year:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\nPrice (CA)\n\n\n\n\nScienceDirect-Freedom Collection, incl. Academic Press Collection\n$1,539,329.53\n\n\nWiley Online Library (Database)\n$801,401.41\n\n\nTaylor & Francis Journals (SSH/S&T/Medical)\n$301,280.04\n\n\nOxford Journals Online\n$125,574.14\n\n\nSage Premier All-Access\n$118,238.42\n\n\nWeb of Science\n$115,703.91\n\n\nScopus\n$69,254.69\n\n\nCambridge Journals Online\n$62,628.47\n\n\nWeb of Knowledge\n$48,556.76\n\n\nRSC Electronic Journals\n$23,965.30\n\n\nNRC Research Press Journals\n$16,348.20\n\n\nMathSciNet and Consortium Database Fees\n$14,125.01\n\n\nTotal\n$3,236,405.88\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unsustainable financial situation has led several universities to cancel journal subscriptions. In 2016, the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) launched the Journal Usage Project (JUP), a national evaluation of journal usage in universities to help libraries assess the state of their collection and either cancel the big deals or negotiate better prices with publishers. The results of this evaluation shed light on the concentration of journal use in Canadian universities, with almost two-thirds of the journals included in the Springer (now Springer-Nature) being considered important for none of the universities included in the study.\n\n\n\nRelative frequency distribution of journals by the number of universities where they are used significantly (Mongeon et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nThe full results of the analysis sponsored by CRKN’s Journal Usage Project are reported in the following article:\nMongeon, P., Siler, K., Archambault, A., Sugimoto, C., & Larivière, V.

Two main models of open access were initially proposed by the Budapest initiative (BOAI): the first one, self-archiving (also known as green open access), allows researchers to deposit their already published articles in open electronic archives also known as repositories. The second one, also known as gold open access, relies on a brand new type of journal that makes new scientific articles immediately available on its website, with no copyright restriction. These new journals would not charge for subscription or access fees. While the original BOAI declaration suggested that these new journals find alternative sources of revenue (such as grants or adds-on that could be sold as an extra), article processing charges (APCs), a publishing fee charged to authors, emerged as one of the main sources of funding for OA journals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nWhat role do you academic librarians and other librarians play (or could play) in supporting Open Access to the scholarly literature?"

Dante has become a public librarian at Saskatoon Public Library, Jude is working at the Nova Scotia Archives, Tracy is a knowledge management corporate consultant in the arts and entertainment sector in Montreal, and Wren has been given a promotion at the tech start-up she works for.\nDante and Jude are both attending a library and archives conference in Lake Como, Italy. The conference party, which takes place on a small, private boat, features many prominent professionals in the field of Information Management.\nThe air is warm as the two disembark the boat at the end of the night discussing the conversations. One speaker that resonated with both of them was Mallory Jensen, an Academic librarian from New York State. She spoke about her work negotiating with publishers to unbundle the academic journals her library purchases so that libraries can save money and only buy the journals their library desires.\nJude: I don’t have to deal with the issues surrounding big academic publishers because I work in archives, but Mallory really is passionate about what she does, and she shed light on how this is an issue with repercussions for all areas of the library. Budget has a huge influence on how resources are distributed in library settings!\nDante: You nailed it, Jude. I have met a few academic librarians through these types of conferences who are also frustrated by this issue. It is already so expensive for universities to purchase these journals. It just seems insane to force them to buy ones they don’t even want.\nJude: It really is! And then on top of that, its ludicrous that universities are having to buy back the research that they’ve already paid their professors to do.\nDante: If only there were a way around it, like if the research could just be found online some way so students and staff could just download and read it for free.\nJude: Arrrrghhhh, I know we just got off a boat, but Dante, you’re talking about piracy! Do you really think that’s a fair solution? How can you guarantee that the authors are being properly compensated if their work is being illegally downloaded?\nDante: I guess I never thought about it that way. When there’s a new book that I really want to read with a long holds list at our library I usually just go online and try to find a free copy to download. I figure I would be reading it for free through the library anyways, so what difference does it make?\nJude: The difference is that downloading it online is immoral! That is someone’s intellectual property. Waiting for a copy from the library or purchasing it at a bookshop is the right thing to do. You could also buy a copy online.\nDante: But why would I buy a digital copy when it’s so easily accessible for free? How can people really be successful selling information online when there’s so much available?\nJude: What about open-access journals? There has been a big movement towards them. They offer freely accessible content in the spirit of democratizing knowledge, but usually charge publication fees in order to make the work they host publicly available. This remedies the problem of the end-user paying abominable subscription fees, though, they carry their own set of issues.

    "section": "7.2 Information in a capitalist system",
    "text": "7.2 Information in a capitalist system\nIn this section, we summarize some of the key elements of Herbert Schiller’s views of the information society, as reported in Webster (2014). Schiller’s perspective, influenced by his economics background and his work as a Professor of Communications, played a central role in the political economy approach to understanding information, which emphasized the importance of “looking behind information” at the structural features that shape the information produced:\n\nIf one wants to understand why newspapers and television produce particular content, […] one ought not to start with an analysis of journalists, editors, or scriptwriters [or of the content itself]. Better far to ask: who owns the operation? What are the priorities of the business? Where does it make its money? (Webster 2014, 152)\n\nThe political economy approach also emphasizes the importance of considering the capitalist system as a whole as well as the role of power, control, and interest and their significance for the information society. Some central points of Schiller’s theory are market principles and practices, corporate capitalism, the commodification of information, and class inequalities.\n\n7.2.1 Market principles and practices\nAccording to Schiller, “the information environment is expressive of the interests and priorities of corporate capitalism” (Webster 2014, 167). Since the main purpose of corporations is the generation of profits, which leads to information being produced and made available only if profits can be made. This determines what information will be produced, by who, for who, and under what conditions it will be made available. Moreover, under corporate capitalism, these decisions tend to be made by a limited number of large corporations that form powerful oligopolies.\n\n\n7.2.2 The commodification of information\nAccording to Schiller and others, information is increasingly commodified so that it can operate in a market society. This means that information gets to be something that one can own, have a price, and be sold or licensed by a party to another (Webster 2014). For information to exist as a commodity, there needs to be a legal framework that supports it, such as intellectual property law. In Canada, the Copyright Act protects the rights of content producers in Canada by granting them exclusive economic rights over their work (Al-Sharieh 2018). However, the principle of fair dealing allows users to use copyrighted information without permission or payment of royalties. The “dealing” must only be for the following purposes; research, private study, criticism, review, news reporting, education, satire, or parody. Another exception is when a work is reproduced in alternative formats in order to increase accessibility for people with perceptual disabilities (Al-Sharieh 2018). This highlights the need for a balance between the rights of the creator and the rights of the user (such as the right to participate in culture or the right to education).\nSchiller believed that information should be a public good, an idea that goes completely against the dominant model. The struggle between the public good and corporate interests is well illustrated in the realm of scholarly publishing, which we explore in more detail below.\n\n\n7.2.3 Class inequalities\nClass inequalities also shape the way that information is produced and distributed, as class can determine what information one has access to. This brings us back to the idea of the digital divide from chapter 3 on information issues. Schiller contends that the information society is one of “information stratification” where some (the minority) are information-rich, and others (the majority, or the “general public”) are information-poor. Furthermore, just like unregulated capitalism naturally leads to monopolies, the natural tendency of this system is to increase the gap between these two groups.\nWhen the ability to profit determines what information you will have access to, the information-poor are those who, by virtue of having the ability to pay, end up lumped together in what we call a “mass market” to which a “cheaper” kind of information can be sold without sacrificing profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat may be the effect of the dominance of market principles on the type of information that is produced, made available, and consumed by the public?\nHow do you think we can determine the value of information?\nDo you think that information should be considered a public good? Why?\nDo you think that you are information-poor or information-rich?\nIs there anything that we can do as information professionals to help with these issues?"

Jude works at the Nova Scotia Archives, and they have directed their employees to work from home in accordance with provincial regulations. Jude initially finds a stable routine helpful; he wakes up in the morning, takes his dog Kevin on a walk, and then begins his workday. As the months go by, Jude finds himself consuming more and more online content instead of doing the things he regularly enjoys. Jude begins to immerse himself heavily in the perspectives of certain online forums and media. The gang grows concerned with Jude’s online behaviours and collectively check in with him in their group chat.\nInfo Masters: Group Chat\n3:07am\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: Hey friends, check out this YouTube video when you get a chance- really interesting perspective… not something you’ll hear on the mainstream media.\n9:45am\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Good morning Jude, et al. I see you were up really late Jude, were you just watching videos all night?\nDantes_infern0: Rise and shine team! Let’s manage information 😊\ntWrending_in_tech: Good morn!! Hmm… I saw this the other day when it was floating around the internet… but only cause I’ve got to keep my finger on the pulse of the web and not because it’s content I usually watch… where did you find this, Jude?\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: Haha, yeah, I was up pretty late. I just kinda fell down a rabbit hole in this online forum I’m a part of and next thing I knew it was 3am. Gotta stop doing that! Let me know what you think about the video.\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Oh dear- Jude, it sounds like nights like that have become the norm? That doesn’t seem like a very healthy lifestyle. Why are you up so late every night?\nDantes_infern0: From the activity logs I can view on the social sites we’re all a part of you seem pretty active on a few different pages and groups. Take a break, my Jude!\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: I don’t need a break. I’m just really curious and interested in learning about viewpoints I’ve never been exposed to. I’ve been finding so much new information from videos and articles shared in these groups.\ntWrending_in_tech: Awe, Jude- we’ve always loved your love of analog formats! So, this comes as a bit of a surprise. It seems like your attention has been captivated by these groups- just based on what I see you reposting and chatting about! (Please don’t be mad, just checking in- ily)\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Well said, Wren! I remember when I first got a few online platforms- I couldn’t tear myself away! There was always new and exciting information out there and everything always felt so urgent. I was afraid to log off and miss new content.\nDantes_infern0: Hahaha- when I first got Facebook, I remember joining so many groups dedicated to raising tropical fish. I got REALLY into it, but after a while, I realized the algorithm was designed to show me things I liked and interacted with. It kind of becomes a positive feedback loop. I’m still leaving fish groups, and that was 5 years ago. I also purchased a fair few fish tanks- dang targeted ads!\ntWrending_in_tech: Hilarious, because I’ve never seen you keep a plant alive for more than a week. Dante’s inferno indeed. Jude, as someone who works in tech, could I kindly suggest that you be careful about where you are investing your attention and time? Some online sites and apps are designed to capture and monetize your attention and aren’t necessarily concerned with the well-being of users… they’re more interested in generating traffic on their sites.\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: No one is forcing me to be active on these groups though… the algorithm is working because I’m genuinely interested in this stuff. It’s free, too! The users are the ones creating all the content. I appreciate your concern, but I think I just get really into stuff, like the time I got back into baking sourdough bread at the start of the outbreak LOL.\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Thanks for that perspective, Wren! It is so easy to feel like we are in control because we are the ones clicking, but many online business models are designed to keep us on their sites. Our attention is a resource and should be protected and treated as such! Remember our Professor in Info in Society in first year telling us “If it’s free, you are the product”? It seems like the information you are finding is a valuable asset here but in reality, the data we provide is more valuable to these companies than the information we obtain from them… at least monetarily. And I understand that, Jude. You are someone who is wholeheartedly invested in what you care about, and that is such a wonderful characteristic of yours! But often our strengths and weaknesses go hand in hand- there is no harm in baking bread, but the viewpoints and content you are consuming so much of can potentially be a bit dangerous, in insidious ways.\nDantes_infern0: I saw a documentary about this recently! These sites are gathering and selling our data. They want users on their sites as long as possible to offer up more of their personal information. They track user behaviours so that they have more generated data to sell. It’s a cycle. Some people get in the habit of consuming information non-stop and don’t realize what they are offering in exchange for it.\ntWrending_in_tech: Agreed! That’s why I cap my screen time now and only go on my social sites intentionally and with premeditated purpose. Otherwise, I just scroll endlessly!\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: I’m surprised by your reactions. I just shared a video I thought was interesting and didn’t mean to cause an entire discourse on the commodification of our attention… talk about diverting attention away from the main point.\ntWrending_in_tech: We just want to make sure you are okay, Jude! With so much information and online content being created non-stop, the only limiting factor is really our attention. I have learned to be more mindful since working in tech. As someone with the inside scoop when it comes to algorithms, they have the potential to create and reinforce stereotypes, biases, and oppression. It’s our social responsibility to be cognizant of that fact and question what we are consuming and why. That’s just one techie’s opinion!\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: Well, thanks for your concern, folks. I’ll take your advice and log off- I’ve got to get back to work. The fonds won’t fawn over themselves, haha. Ttyl!\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Thanks for the morning chat, all! Glad we got to check in with you, Jude!\nDantes_infern0: Yeah- this convo has made me consider public libraries’ roles in protecting patrons’ privacy and not revealing what resources are used and by whom. I’m going to go see what books we carry on these topics.\ntWrending_in_tech: And I’ll get back to my big evil tech company! Bahaha >:) jk. Have a lovely day all!\nChat ended.\nConsider the themes discussed in the group chat. The gang observes that Jude’s attention has been monopolized by online groups sharing distinct points of view. They raise concerns over Jude’s level of awareness regarding the commodification of user attention and urge him to be mindful of this fact as he navigates online landscapes."

Fake news has been defined in many different ways but generally can be seen as false news articles that mislead the reader (De Paor and Heravi 2020). Fake news is co-constructed by its audience, because if the audience does not believe it then it automatically becomes fiction. There are many different kinds of fake news including news satire, news parody, news fabrication, advertising and propaganda.

    "text": "9.3 Origins of Misinformation\nMisinformation can arise in many different ways. One way is that rumors and fiction may be considered to be true. People are more likely to pass on information that evokes emotion regardless of if it is truthful. This is a common occurrence with information gleaned through gossip. People may also read fictional stories and believe that what they are reading is true (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).\nThe government and politicians are also known to spread misinformation. People are often unable to determine which information is true and false, especially surrounding elections. People often expect to encounter some misinformation during elections (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).\nThe media, including social media are also spreaders of misinformation. The media can take true information from scientific studies and twist it in a way that can be misinterpreted- by oversimplifying, misrepresenting or over-dramatizing scientific results. The media often tries to portray balanced stories but sometimes this can create misleading outcomes. Social media too is a huge spreader of misinformation. Anyone can post information online without professional editors or fact checkers verifying the truthfulness of their statements. Hoax websites exist solely to spread mis- and disinformation. Selective exposure may also occur if people are only seeking out media sources that confirm their existing beliefs (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an example of a fictional story that was believed to be true?\nCan you think of a time when the media may have presented you with misleading information?"

    "text": "9.4 How does misinformation spread?\nThe internet creates filter bubbles in which people’s social media feeds and Google searches are filtered to only include information that is in line with their currently existing beliefs. In the Ted Talk below, Eli Pariser describes filter bubbles as “your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online”. The main problem with this is that people are not shown any opposing views which only serves to strengthen their current views. If the views that are held are false, they will still be shown more information that aligns with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n People believe and spread misinformation for a myriad of reasons. People often don’t know that something is misinformation until it is corrected and even then, they may have a hard time believing the corrected information if it does not align with their beliefs. Worldview and personal ideology play a role in people’s willingness to believe misinformation- people will often argue anything that goes against their pre-existing worldview (Lewandowsky et al. 2012). People also struggle to identify whether or not a source is reliable. If an information source is persuasive people are more likely to believe that it is credible. People so rarely look into their sources that most often people remember the gist of the information they read but not the source it came from. This shows how important it is for people to consider the sources they are getting their information from and whether they may be biases or misleading. It has also been shown that retractions often don’t work – people sometimes believe the information more after a retraction because they have now been repeatedly exposed to it. This is because the more familiar information becomes the truer it can seem (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\nWith a friend, Google something related to a current event happening in the world and compare your results.

If a retraction is necessary, it’s important that it be repeated so that the true information becomes more memorable. Another good way to combat misinformation is to provide an alternative explanation – one that is plausible and explains why the misinformation was considered true originally. Lastly, promoting healthy skepticism can help reduce people’s susceptibility to misinformation because it makes people question the information they are given (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think is a good way to promote healthy skepticism?\nIf you had a friend who believed in misinformation how would you go about helping them to see that it is false?"

In the past, librarians acted as fact checkers, but going forward they must act as educators. This is because librarians are incapable of keeping up with the level of misinformation online. One way to do this is to hold information literacy classes at the library. Information literacy has been cited as an effective way to deal with misinformation and fake news. It has been defined as “the ability to think critically and make balanced judgements about any information we find and use” (De Paor and Heravi 2020, 4) .

It’s been a few months since I’ve listened to an episode, but I’ve heard from a few acquaintances that the podcast was doing well.\nDante: That’s great, Jude! Well done. You’re like King Midas of going viral! Everything you apply yourself to just takes off!\nJude: Thanks, Dante. I wish this time it didn’t, though. I was doing some work late tonight and put the latest episode on in the background. There was some pretty harmful content to the LGBTQ community on it. I’m abhorred. I can’t believe I was a part of setting up the infrastructure for this show and contributed to giving this guy a platform to spread messaging this alarming.\nDante: Oh no. That’s terrible. I’m sorry Jude. Can you get in touch with the podcaster and talk to him about it? Or remove yourself from the project?\nJude: Good suggestion, Dante. That’s definitely what I want to do, but I’m a little intimidated. This guy has a following that is growing by the day. I want to stop him from putting more content and messaging like this out there for listeners, but I’m worried about his influence and… you know I’m not very confrontational.\nDante: I know, Jude. I get it. It can be scary to take a stand. But hey, I can do it then! That’s totally my style- it’s time to bring some heat! They don’t call me Dante’s inferno for nothing!\nJude: Thanks Dante, but I don’t know… I need to think on this. Maybe I can write him a thoughtful email with some well-supported points and he will reconsider what he’s doing.\nDante: You know what? Wren will know what to do. Tracy will have great perspective too- but she has her kids so I’ll let her rest.\n*Dante Facetimes Wren and she joins their call. Jude explains the situation to Wren and Dante offers their suggestion of butt-kicking*\nWren: Hmm… let me investigate this. *Furious typing* So from what I’ve been able to find, his podcast stats show that his views are growing steadily, but they’re still menial compared to the big fish of the podcasting world. So that’s a positive thing… to slow them down even further I could hack into the cloud and delete all the content and resources in his personal drive!\nDante: …who are you?\nJude: The reason I’m nervous to say anything to him is because I don’t want to do anything that could cause more anger and backlash directed against the LGBTQ community. I know what he’s broadcasting is wrong and harmful, but I feel like it needs to be addressed in a way that wouldn’t inspire him to anger.\nDante: This reminds me of the library in Toronto that allowed an anti-trans speaker to give a presentation in their space. The 2SLGBTQIA+ community responded by having a protest outside the library and had more trans and trans-allies there than there were audience members who came to see the author speak.\nWren: That seems like a really effective and powerful way to combat harmful perspectives like this. What do you think, Jude? Could you organize something like that in response to the podcast site? *Furious typing quickens* I’m looking at the podcast website- if I redirect the viewers to advertisements, it just sends them to extreme-right wing funded organizations. Not a good approach. We’ll have to find another strategy.\nDante: I think some information should be censored on mass media platforms like podcasts. Hate speech has no intrinsic societal value and is undeserving of protection.\nJude: I agree Dante, but I have to wonder if counter speech is the better approach? Don’t you think the strongest ideals prevail? The minimal amount of regulation that exists in the podcasting world facilitates unfettered discourse and there are much better ideas out there that promote love over hate!\nDante: Well, Jude, I think existing imbalances of power and prejudices make it difficult for marginalized communities to confront harmful messaging on equal footing.\nJude: I agree Dante. Thanks for talking this through with me. And thank you both for all of your help. I feel like this situation is all my fault. You were right about those forums becoming feedback loops. I didn’t question or validate the information I was finding because it was so novel to me. I was looking for one thing and didn’t realize who I was surrounded with or being influenced by. I don’t know what to do… I am going to think about it some more, but I know it’s unethical of me to ignore it.\nDante: We are glad you see that side of things now Jude, we’ll always try to steer you right. It’s good you’ve recognized those things and just know that we are here to help you in any way you need. Dante’s inferno is always ready to be unleashed, just say the word.\nWren: Yeah, the podcaster took advantage of how helpful and kind you are. It doesn’t sound like he was upfront about the nature of his show with you or you never would have supported it. Now Jude… what’s your laptop password? You are a good person, you’ll do the right thing, and I’m glad you called us. But… you don’t need to know what happens next. *Furious typing intensifies*\n\n9.8.1 Epilogue\n*Jude Facetimes Wren*\nJude: Hey Wren, I just wanted to check in and see if there were any updates on last night. What did you end up doing, after all?\nWren: Oh Jude, that is classified information. Need to know basis, you know?\nJude: Wren, I appreciate it, but it’s not something that will cause any backlash, will it? You can tell me; I won’t be upset.\nWren: Oh Jude. I didn’t do anything wild. Also, you should probably stick to analog tech- the 1990’s called and want their website design back. Changing the SEO was super easy. There’s some technical stuff like with root directories and assigning it not to be indexed, but I also changed all the keywords into Klingon. No one will ever find it! Bwahaha! (ghuy’cha’ in Klingon)\nJude: You are a genius, Wren! I am forever indebted to you and hereby declare my undying servitude.\nWren: I’m just glad to have my friend Jude back. Now get some sleep and we can discuss your debt of servitude later!\n\n\n9.8.2 Discussion Questions\nConsidering the themes of misinformation and disinformation and the conversation above answer the following discussion questions.\n\nWhat is the difference between misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation?\nWhat sort of information is being spread/perpetuated through the podcast Jude helped to get started?\n\n\n\nHow can media and information literacy play a role in counteracting misinformation and disinformation?\n\n\n\nDo you think that media platforms (e.g. Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, etc.) are responsible for censoring content broadcast through their sites through policies that regulate harmful content, or should content and self-censorship be left to creators?

    "text": "10.2 The Public Sphere\nThe concept of the public sphere, which was developed by Jürgen Habermas (1999), can be defined as:\n\n[A]n arena, independent of government while also enjoying autonomy from sectional economic forces, which is dedicated to rational debate (i.e., to debate and discussion which is not ‘interested’, ‘disguised’ or ‘manipulated’) and which is both accessible to entry and open to inspection by the citizenry. It is here, in this public sphere, that public opinion is formed. (Webster 2014)\n\nThe public sphere is not just a single place or a time, it’s a concept that encompasses both physical and digital spaces, and it is a combination of all those spaces where conversations, ideas and minds meet. The public sphere is also constantly evolving, and its development is greatly affected by technological advances and our increased reliance on digital modes of information exchange (McKee 2004).\nIn this short video, Fred Turner discusses the emergence of a digital utopia that envisions digital technologies as enabling a world of free democratic choices and heightened consciousness that is diverse and free of sexism and racism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of the vision that Turner describes? Do you also think that this vision may be revived? What would need to happen for this to happen?\n\n\nMcKee (2004) discusses five issues with the public sphere.\n\nIt is too trivialized; people care more about unimportant news like celebrities’ lives than they do real-world events\nIt is too commercialized: the media wants to make money, and, in the process, quality suffers.\nIt’s a spectacle: the public looks for eye-catching visuals and superficial distractions over meaningful conversations about serious issues.\nIt’s too fragmented: national culture falls to the wayside while niche identity groups become more common. People are less interested in the same general information\nIt has made citizens apathetic to important public issues: people care less about the important political issues of their country.\n\nThere are many obstacles to participation in the public sphere. Many of the obstacles found in the real world also translate directly to online communities. The Internet was meant to make politics more inclusive, allowing more people to voice their opinions. It was meant to allow for equal participation. Instead, the Internet reinforces many of the problems seen in the offline world (Albrecht 2006)."

When looking at the public sphere through this framework, public libraries are clearly part of the public sphere. Libraries were created under the pretense that information belongs to everyone and should be available to everyone. They provide equal access to information for everyone at no cost so that people may be well-informed and able to participate in public debates (Audunson et al. 2019). They are publicly funded by taxation, but their operations are still separate from political interests (Webster 2014). Public libraries also help to encourage democracy by providing a space for people to gather and debate. Friends, neighbours, and strangers gather in the public library generating social capital. Communities with high er social capital tend to have higher civic participation. On top of providing space, libraries also provide the materials people need to learn and be informed of the issues (Appleton and Hall 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and Reflect\n\n\n\nHow do you think you, in your future career as an information professional, can work to limit the obstacles to participation for the community you serve?\nHow do you balance intellectual freedom with advocacy and/or activism?"

We interact with our friends, family, neighbours, community members, and more on social media platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nConsider the prerequisites for the democratic ideal. How do they pertain to social media platforms?\n\n\nConsider following excerpt from York and Zuckerman (2019):\n\nWhile the real-name policy shifts the balance of power from users to platform owners, increasing the costs for bad behavior, it may be accompanied by another effect: a growing reticence on the part of users to produce content. Facebook routinely prompts users to post content, recycling past posts as memories ready for reposting, assembling albums commemorating friendships between two users so they have something new to post. Scholar Trebor Scholz points out that platforms like Facebook rely on its users to create content—without user-created content, the sites would have nothing to offer (Scholz 2012). This insight has yet to turn into the workers’ rights movement Scholz and others have hoped for. While concerns are sometimes raised that the growth of platforms like Facebook is slowing, user-generated content sites are the most popular and powerful sites on the Internet.\nAccording to analytics company Alexa, six of the top ten websites in the United States, in terms of traffic, are built on user-generated content—YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, Reddit, eBay, and Twitter—and two others, Google and Yahoo!, are arguably built on indexing user-generated content. At this point, user-generated content sites are not the exception to the rule but the dominant model of the social web. The beauty of this model for the platforms is that users do almost all of the work. The platform is responsible only for providing a space where a user can publish, while the user does the work of creating the content. The platform succeeds fiscally if it can make more from advertising on user content than it spends creating and maintaining the space. (York and Zuckerman 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nDo sites relying on user-generated content reflect the democratic ideal? Why or why not?"

    "text": "10.6 Algorithms, Automation, and Echo-Chambers\nWhile human users generate most of the content on social media platforms, that content is not necessarily user-curated. Instead, most social media platforms use algorithms to curate content. While the exact programming of many algorithms is shrouded in secrecy, curation can be determined by what the user has selected to view before, who they follow on social media, or other information gathered from the user. While this can create a tailored experience, it can also create echo chambers, where users will see and share content similar to what they already enjoy and endorse instead of being exposed to diverse information. For example, consider the author and law-expert Frank Pasquale’s writings on the automation of the public sphere:\n\nThe basic contours of mass media-driven politics and culture remained stable through much of the second half of the twentieth century. But since the mid-1990s, the public sphere has endured yet another structural transformation. Megafirms like Facebook and Google have largely automated the types of decisions once made by managers and programmers at television networks, or editors at newspapers. Automated recommendations are often helpful, aiding audiences as they seek to sort out the blooming, buzzing confusion of topics online. But they are also destabilizing traditional media institutions and circuits of knowledge. (Pasquale 2018)\n\nPasquale also writes about how the anonymity offered by the Internet can influence the public sphere:\n\nWhile secrecy has empowered some voices who would otherwise be afraid to speak up, it has also protected trolls, doxers, and other bad actors online who silence others’ speech via intimidation. Moreover, online anonymity is of a piece with financial anonymity, which has empowered thousands of shell companies to obscure who is actually funding messages that could sway the public, legislators, and regulators. Everyone is invited to participate, but so too is “everyone” capable of disrupting other communities of interest online, via hashtag spamming or trolling—whether by civil society groups, state actors, or miscreants pursuing disruption “for the lulz.” (Pasquale 2018)"

Sociologist and writer Zeynep Tufekci speaks to the challenges and successes of social movements online:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n York and Zuckerman (2019) give the following example of how social media can be successful at initiating social change:\n\nSocial media has emerged as a battleground for human rights defenders because of its value in mobilizing resistance movements and in publicizing otherwise invisible points of view. The 2011 uprisings in the Arab world and beyond demonstrated the mobilizing power of UGC platforms, while their aftermath—from the emergence of new democratic norms in some places to war in others—exhibited UGC platforms’ value in the documentation of human rights abuses. In late 2010, a Facebook page emerged in Egypt entitled”We Are All Khaled Said” (in English and in Arabic). Set up to memorialize Khaled Said, a young man killed by police in Alexandria, the page was then used to promote an already-organized set of protests, following in the footsteps of the Tunisian protests that had just effectively deposed the country’s autocratic leader of twenty-three years, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The page’s call to protest went viral among Egyptians, many of whom had previously only used Facebook for ordinary activities and communications, and on January 25, 2011, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest. The initial effectiveness of the Egyptian uprising, which deposed long-term autocrat Hosni Mubarak, inspired movements throughout the Arab region and well beyond. Some of those movements, such as that which took hold in Syria in February 2011, sparked violent clashes, leading to civil war. In the case of Syria, social media has been effective both in documenting and sharing human rights abuses, as well as in the dissemination of propaganda. Such content is not immune from the impact of content moderation; Facebook and YouTube have both been accused of contributing to the erasure of evidence from Syria. (York and Zuckerman 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nHave you seen movements of social change originate or propagate in your social media platform of choice or elsewhere online?"

It’s been a while since they graduated, and their conversation centers on changes in the public sphere and how they understand their evolving roles in the realm of Information Management.\nDante: How have you all been? It always feels like too much time passes between these video chats. I wish we all still lived in Halifax, but it’s great to have us all together now. We missed you in these calls, Jude!\nJude: Hey all, I missed you too. It’s really nice to see your faces and hear your voices. I want all the updates!\nWren: Well, I’ll go first because I’m sure you’re all dying to hear about the fabulous lifestyle of Wren Reilly. I’ve been good! So busy with working at the tech company and volunteering in my spare time, but happy, nonetheless. Halifax misses you, Dante!\nTracy: That is wonderful to hear, Wren. I love seeing your updates on Instagram. I’ve also been inordinately busy! My daughter Ava just started grade ten and is enrolled in one too many extra curriculars, if you ask me. And she’s struggling with speaking French here in Montreal.\nDante: That’s a hard age for sure, I wouldn’t want to go back to being fifteen. I know you’ve told us Ava is a big Taylor Swift fan! I was scrolling through YouTube in bed last night and ended up watching her speech after she was presented an honorary doctorate in fine arts at NYU.\nWren: I watched that too! My roommate is a huge Swiftie so I’m always in tune with what’s happening with her. She had me watch her documentary as well.\nJude: I also watched it- she’s a very eloquent speaker.\nDante: What did you think of her speech? I found it really interesting when she talked about the issues she has dealt with being in the public sphere, especially how hard it was to almost be cancelled online back in 2016. It made me think about your situation with the podcast, Jude.\nWren: Definitely some parallels there! In her documentary Taylor talks about finding it difficult to express herself or her political views due to the fear of being canceled or polarizing her fans. It must be so hard to be famous and constantly having to worry about what you say or do or post online for fear of backlash.\nTracy: It’s not just famous people who have to worry about those things. The public sphere isn’t safe for a lot of people. In fact, I haven’t told you guys yet but just recently Ava decided to come out on Instagram. She posted a photo of herself and her girlfriend with a caption about how they’re together. She thought she was ready, but people are really being awful online. She has strangers and classmates writing hateful comments on her post and sending her mean DMs.\nJude: You are right. When I was dealing with that podcast situation, I was worried about creating more backlash against the LGBTQ+ community but I couldn’t continue enabling the spread of hateful messages and so I said I couldn’t take part in the show anymore. I’m disappointed to hear that Ava’s classmates aren’t being supportive, Tracy. I’m glad she has a mom like you!\nDante: Oh Tracy! I am so sorry to hear that, Ava is such a sweet girl and doesn’t deserve to deal with that. I really feel like social media creates so many issues. Anonymous strangers shouldn’t be able to make people feel so bad. It’s so easy for people to say things online that they wouldn’t say in person.\nWren: Yes, I really hope things get better for Ava soon! This makes me think of the debate that some of my colleagues and I have been having of whether or not social media actually improves society. When it was first created, I feel like the idea was that it would create a platform where everyone’s opinions could be heard, and the democratic value of free speech would thrive. But clearly this isn’t quite true.\nTracy: Oh, it’s definitely not true, social media has become a place diluted with misinformation and has created polarization between different groups of people. Different communities only see similar opinions to their own thanks to the algorithms that run these sites which creates a positive feedback loop, reinforcing people’s own biases. Look at what happened to Jude… it is so easy to find yourself down a rabbit hole surrounded by viewpoints that are cleverly disguised, or just drown out any sensible ways of being. He was sucked into helping to distribute the same nonsense, and that’s not the Jude we know! Thankfully, he found his way back to his ethics and values, with help from his friends.\nWren: *Grinning widely* and a little bit of Wren’s magic, of course.\nJude: You’re so right Tracy, it’s something that worries me a lot. I often think about what I can do as an information professional to help change this. Maybe ways that I can educate people about these issues?\nTracy: I often feel that way too Jude. I honestly have been feeling so helpless with Ava’s situation, I just want her to be safe and happy and right now she isn’t feeling either. I don’t think she realized the sort of bigger political sphere she was stepping into by coming out so publicly. I just hope that it doesn’t affect her in any way going forward.\nWren: We are here for you and Ava, Tracy. Please reach out anytime even if you need to talk. This can’t be easy for you as her mother.\nJude: I agree! We love you, Tracy.\nDante: Hear! Hear!\nTracy: Thanks, everyone! You really know how to help me feel better. I appreciate the chat and looking forward to catching up again soon!"

One such way is providing information seekers with resources to learn about what social injustices are and how they may be affecting them. This allows people to gain the tools to fight against this oppression. Another way is by advocating for social justice both locally and globally and treating all people justly who access information services. It is also helpful if LIS professionals work to support diversity within the profession (Mathiesen 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of any other ways that LIS professionals can fight against social injustice?

In museums?\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Informational justice framework\nThe informational justice framework lays out three types of informational social justice which are related to the ways in which people can relate to information. The three types of informational justice are connected in a way that if an institution is lacking in one, they are often lacking in the others.\n\niDistributive justice: To be treated justly as seekers people should have equal access to information\niParticipatory justice: To be treated justly as sources all people should have an equal chance to contribute to information and knowledge.

    "section": "11.3 Theories of distribution",
    "text": "11.3 Theories of distribution\nThere are many different theories of distribution and the ways in which information can be made accessible to the most people. Here we will look into three different ones. While reading, consider what fallbacks each of these theories may have.\nThe first is the distribution of personal satisfaction. In this theory the idea is that the goods that need to be equally distributed are pleasure, happiness or preference satisfaction. People often adapt their preferences to their environments and to what they think it is possible for them to achieve. So, using this model, you may in fact reinforce inequalities due to social factors such as sexism, racism, poverty or disability. For example, if women in a sexist society have lower expectations for career success, they are likely to be satisfied with less than men are (Mathiesen 2015).\nThe second theory has to do with the distribution of resources. This theory focuses on resources as being primary goods, referring to \"rights and liberties, opportunities and powers, and income and wealth\" (pg. 210). In this model it is also possible to consider access to information as a primary good. The thought is that those with more primary goods are more likely to be successful. The problem with this model is that two people with the same amount of primary goods may still have unequal opportunity. This is because people are so different in their needs. For example, someone with many health problems, or a disability that requires a lot of expensive equipment will not have the same opportunities as a healthy person even if they have the same amount of primary goods. When looking at libraries through this lens you can see other issues as well. For example, in a library a blind person will not have the same access to information as others as they may require assistive devices or braille to access library resources (Mathiesen 2015).\nThe last theory looks at the distribution of capabilities. In this theory it is a person's capabilities that are measured as opposed to their resources. These capabilities can be as simple as the ability to move about, the ability to meet one's nutritional needs or the ability to acquire clothing and shelter. In this theory one would look at whether the distribution of information resources allows people to gain these capabilities (Mathiesen 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\nHow do you think that LIS professionals and researchers can evaluate the levels of capabilities of their community? Do you think that it's possible?\nCan you think of an example of how a library could help its patrons to gain certain capabilities?\n\n\nThe focus should be less on the information as the resource and more on access to information as a resource. Access to information can be understood as a capability sensitive resource. With this idea, one can make information more accessible by changing either the condition of the information or the condition of the person. There are five factors that can help to determine whether information is accessible to a particular group or person.\nAvailability: does the information exist?\nFindability: can the information be found?\nReachability: can the seekers get the information?\nComprehensibility: can the information be understood?\nUsability: is the information useful?\nIt is also important to look at whether information is intellectually, physically or socioculturally accessible (Mathiesen 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nCan you think of a way that changing the condition of the person could result in better access to information?\nCan you think of a way that information could be intellectually comprehensible but not physically comprehensible?\nIn what ways do you think that problems with findability, availability and reachability affect unhoused and poor populations?\nHow do you think that information professionals can work to solve these issues?"

When Ontario locked down and sent all students home to attend school virtually it was obvious that there was a huge disconnect between those students with access to internet and technologies and those without. This was a clear case of a digital divide preventing certain parts of society from access to information. The Ontario government began an initiative in which it distributed 21,000 iPads and free data for school aged children (ages 4-18). In this case, access to internet, and in turn the access to information, is considered a human right. Although this was a great initiative there were downfalls, the main one being that with over two million students enrolled in Ontario schools, only 1% were provided with iPads. This is when 14% of Ontario households were deemed to have slow or no internet connectivity. One must question whether idistributive justice was achieved (Smith 2021)."

    "text": "11.3 Informational Justice in Museums\nMuseums are, traditionally, physical locations that serve a community by collecting, preserving, and presenting cultural heritage objects. However, museum institutions often come out of colonial contexts. When considering informational justice in the museum sector, those colonial pasts (and presents) must be examined and understood in order to pave the way for a future where the information and objects that are managed by museums are exemplary of justice, not bastions of inequality.\nThe collections of cultural heritage objects in many Canadian and international museums are made up of objects that were removed from their cultures and places of origin through dubious means or without consent. The provenance of these items is sometimes hotly debated, and many institutions are repatriating objects to their places/cultures of origin in an attempt to reflect modern mandates that are more supportive of informational justice and equality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the news\n\n\n\nhttps://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/11/risd-museum-returns-stolen-benin-bronze-sculpture-to-nigerian-national-collection\n\n\nAs information managers, we can also be critical of the information that surrounds cultural heritage objects inside of museum spaces. For example, many Canadian institutions displayed indigenous cultural heritage objects alongside information that suggested the cultures of origin were extinct, when in reality, many indigenous cultures are alive, resilient, and thriving in the present day. Many exhibits are curated with the intent to display certain cultures as foreign, and these exhibits are often curated without the input of people relevant to those objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nHow does this relate to Mathieson’s Informational Justice Framework?\n\n\nConsider the following quotation from writer, poet, and community organizer, Jamara Wakefield:\n\nMuseums could be one of our greatest allies in liberation struggles. They have the physical space, the means, and the public confidence to partake in a large scale social movement against colonial powers. Yet they reject this opportunity over and over again. They prefer to remain silent and hide in a world that desperately needs decolonizing. (Wakefield 2019)\n\nMike Muraswski, author of Museums as Agents of Change, wrote the following on how colonial culture effects many aspects of museums:\n\nIt dictates how people hold meetings together, who is invited to those meetings, who participates, and whose ideas are valued.” It dictates decision making in museum spaces. It controls how we define “community,” how we work with community partners and what we value about those partners. White dominant culture dictates “the words that get written on museum websites and on the panels and labels in the galleries, who gets to write, edit, and approve those words. (Murawski 2021)\n\nMurawski (2021) wrote the following points on Identifying and Replacing White Dominant Culture In Museums:\n\nMove from a focus on professional and transactional relationships toward relationships based on trust, care, and shared commitments\nMove from protecting power to sharing power.\nMove from a culture of overworking to a culture of self-care and community care\nMove from a competition and struggle for limited resources to a mindset of collaboration and working to share resources\nMove away from prioritizing only degrees, work experience, and job titles toward a way of recognizing and centering lived experience\nMove from a place of those with power making decisions for others toward a place where we work to include those affected by decisions in the decision-making process."

    "text": "11.2 The informational justice framework\nKay Mathiesen (2015) defines a socially just society as one in which everyone is given equal opportunities and all groups are treated equally and fairly. She proposes an informational justice framework that includes three components:\n\niDistributive justice: To be treated justly as seekers people should have equal access to information\niParticipatory justice: To be treated justly as sources all people should have an equal chance to contribute to information and knowledge. Everyone’s opinions and points of view should be taken into account, and everyone should have equal right to contribute to decision making about information resources.\niRecognitional justice: information should have fair representations of people and society.\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n\n\nLet us now consider these three components in a little more detail.\n\n11.2.1 Distribution\nIn her article, Mathiesen (2015) considers three theories of distribution and their relevance for the information perspective. The first is the equal distribution of personal satisfaction according to which pleasure, satisfaction and happiness are the goods that need to be distributed equally between people. From this perspective, we should strive to provide information to people in a way that satisfies their needs and expectations. One issue is that people adjust their expectations based on their experiences and environments, so applying this model may actually reinforce inequalities by giving more to those who need more by virtue of having more, and less to those who need less by virtue of having less. Another way to think of justice is to consider the equal distribution of resources, with information being the resource that we would consider in the field. The problem with this approach is that two people with the same amount of information may not derive the same benefit from it. In a library where everyone has access to the same resources, some patrons may not be able to make use of these resources to the same extent as others. For example a visually impaired person who requires assistive devices to access the resources. Finally, the equal distribution of capabilities approach focuses on a person’s capabilities as opposed to their resources. These capabilities can be as simple as the ability to move about, the ability to meet one’s nutritional needs or the ability to acquire clothing and shelter. So here we might think of how the distribution of information provides everyone with the same level of capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\niDistributive Justice: A Real-World Example\n\n\n\nWhen Ontario locked down due to COVID-19 and sent all students home to attend school virtually it was obvious that there was a huge disconnect between those students with access to internet and technologies and those without. This was a clear case of a digital divide preventing certain parts of society from access to information. The Ontario government began an initiative in which it distributed 21,000 iPads and free data for school aged children (ages 4-18). In this case, access to internet, and in turn the access to information, is considered a human right. Although this was a great initiative there were downfalls, the main one being that with over two million students enrolled in Ontario schools, only 1% were provided with iPads. This is when 14% of Ontario households were deemed to have slow or no internet connectivity. One must question whether idistributive justice was achieved (Smith 2021).\n\n\nFor Mathiesen (2015), the field needs to focus on access, which she sees as a combination of resources (the information) and the capabilities (to make use of the information).\n\n\n\nSource: Mathiesen (2015)\n\n\nThinking about access this way provides us with two main areas of intervention to make information more accessible: acting on the information itself or acting on the users or potential users of the information. Here are five factors that can help to determine whether information is accessible to a particular group or person.\nAvailability: does the information exist?\nFindability: can the information be found?\nReachability: can the seekers get the information?\nComprehensibility: can the information be understood?\nUsability: is the information useful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nCan you think of other factors that information managers can consider to make information accessible for all?\nHow can we improve access to information by focusing on the users or potential users of information?\nHow can information be intellectually comprehensible but not physically comprehensible, and vice versa?\nHow can findability, availability and reachability issues affect unhoused and poor populations?\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Participation\nThe participation element of Mathiesen’s informational justice framework is related to the concept of participatory justice which “refers to the direct participation of those affected most by a particular decision, in the decision-making process itself: this could refer to decisions made in a court of law or by policymakers” (Wikipedia). In the realm of information, participatory justice thus refers to the equal opportunity for people to participate in the production and dissemination of information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nIn the pre-digital world, the means of production and dissemination of information were concentrated into the hands of media organization and governments. Now, the Internet and social media have leveled the playing field so that anyone can have a voice and participate equally into the production and dissemination of information.\n\nWhat do you think of this statement? In what ways do you think it is true or not true?\nWhy do you think it matters to have equal access to the means of producing and disseminating information?\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Recognition\nThe recognition part of the informational justice framework emphasizes the importance of respecting identities and cultural differences. To help you think of recognitional justice from an information lens, consider the way that negative stereotypes about certain groups or cultures can be spread and reinforced in the news and social media, through informational processes. You may also find useful to replace the term recognition with representation, and think of iRecognitional justice as the right for all people to be fairly represented in the informational world. This idea celebrates the plurality of perspectives that are constructed through discourse and that are to be considered as equal, as opposed to the idea of a single objective truth for us to know or the existence of “grand narratives” that represent the dominant perspective on the world and its history.\nThe Truth and Recognition Commission of Canada is a good example of an attempt to deconstruct a grand narrative about the history of Canada, and to establish a “new history” of the country that better represents the lived experiences and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nMathiesen (2015) emphasizes the interdependence of distributive, participatory, and recognitional justice.\n\nHow does iDistributive justice relate to iParticipatory justice?\nHow does iParticipatory justice relate iRecognitional justice?\nHow does iDistributive justice relate to iRecognitional justice?\nHow do you think the three components of the framework come into play in the Truth and Reconciliation process?"

They discuss ways to address epistemic injustice and digital divides as Tracy contemplates moving their family down to the States.\nTracy: Hey Jude, how have you been old friend?\nJude: Hi Tracy! It’s so nice to see you! It’s been a few weeks since we’ve been able to catch up. I’ve just been buried deep in the Archives, as usual. To be honest with you, that whole situation with the podcaster made me really take a step back from my side projects so I could think deeply about everything. I might take a break from my blog for a bit. How about you- how are you and Ava doing?\nTracy: I’ve been good. Very busy with Ava as per usual. My partner has been back in the Netherlands looking after his parents for the last few months so there’s been a lot on my plate, since I’m essentially acting as a single parent.\nJude: That sounds like a lot. How has Ava’s experience at school been since her and her girlfriend went public?\nTracy: I think over the past few weeks the buzz around school has petered off, but they are still receiving some hateful messages online. We’ve been having a lot of conversations lately about boundaries with social media and ways they can take care of their mental health. I tell Ava not to read the messages she receives, but I know they have a big impact on her whether she reads them through or not. Delete and block, I say!\nJude: I am sorry to hear that. That is good advice- there is nothing to be gained by reading those messages.\nTracy: I agree. Though I know Ava has voiced that she wants to converse with them and present a different perspective. She is a lot like you in some ways, Jude. She wants to do good and provide people with information.\nJude: Well, I am sure she will be much better at it than I am. I think my days of social justice blogging are behind me. I feel terrible that I helped out that podcaster and I think I need some time off. I’m sorry I made it possible for them to speak their message. I guess it’s more painful now that I’m realizing how it affected my friends and their families.\nTracy: Oh, but Jude, you didn’t know what he was putting out there- and your blog before was so well-received. It was educational, kind, and I know it inspired its readers to positive action! Think of all the great comments you used to get!\nJude: That is generous of you, Tracy. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been thinking that many of my readers also came from places of privilege, and I wasn’t reaching the people who I really wanted to reach. My readership- they have technology, they’re educated. I’m inspired by Ava; how do you reach those who don’t have access to the same perspectives or resources. How do you introduce people to different ways of knowing and doing?\nTracy: That’s a good point, Jude. Epistemic injustice runs deep, and it is built into online structures just as it exists in the physical institutions and places we inhabit. It can be even harder to spot online because it is intangible, and the internet is so interconnected. Information is changed and influenced on all sides. Users are creators, authors, and audiences all at once. Ava’s school has a class on digital literacy where they discuss these themes. Their end-of-term project is coming up and we have been talking about them quite a bit- especially in light of recent events!\nJude: Has Ava ever considered starting her own podcast? It would be a really cool idea for her and her classmates to have open discussions about these sorts of things and make them available for their peers and teachers to listen to. It might help engage them all in conversation on these topics, and as a new class begins each year they could have multiple seasons!\nTracy: What a fascinating idea, Jude! See- we can’t keep you away from trying to help others out! While I think that has real potential, I am not sure that Ava’s school has the technological infrastructure to support an initiative like that. The digital divide is quite poignant in our town- the schoolboard just doesn’t have the resources to keep up with advancing technical change. Their school only got open Wi-Fi last year!\nJude: Hmm… well… now that my podcasting days are behind me, I’d like to redirect that effort somewhere that is needed. I have a ton of equipment in my studio, and I’d be happy to gift it to Ava’s school to get a project like this off of the ground. I could even teach a few workshops on how to use the equipment and set them up with basic software to record episodes.\nTracy: I’m sure they would be happy to hear from you- why don’t I see if I can put you in touch? It’s great to have the old Jude back, this sounds more like him! Ok, Jude - stay out of trouble. Thanks for meeting me here at the hotel for a coffee. I’d better check on Ava and then wrap up the conference. We’re taking a red eye out of here tonight. I’ll see you in Canmore?”\nJude: “Good to see you, Tracy. Thanks for chatting. Yes, I’ll definitely be in Canmore - I’m excited to get everyone together again!”\nThere are many changes on the horizon for each of the characters and with the five-year anniversary of their time at Dalhousie they’ve decided to come together in Canmore, Alberta for a celebratory trip. The four of them are out for a nice dinner on a patio overlooking the mountains discussing what their future plans are.\nDante: Thank you so much for planning this trip, Tracy! I’m so happy to have a relaxing vacation before my big move. And glad we chose such a convenient location, the drive from Saskatoon wasn’t too bad.\nTracy: I’m so happy it worked out! It’s been a while since all four of us have been together and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. I’m glad we were all able to get vacation time set aside.\nJude: This was the perfect idea, the mountains are so gorgeous, and some outdoor therapy can never hurt.\nWren: Very true! Tell us about your new job Dante! We’re all so proud of you, and this is such a big move for you.\nDante: Well as you know I’ll be working at Iqaluit Centennial Library in Nunavut as the Chief Librarian. It’s always been my dream to run a library so I’m super excited for this new chapter in my life. There’s so much I want to do there, but the number one thing I want to accomplish is closing the digital divide. There are so many access issues in Northern Canada. I want to create programming to teach children about digital literacy and help kids through some of the issues they may be dealing with like online bullying.\nWren: Dante that is so lovely! That sounds like the perfect job for you. Tracy how are things with your job?\nTracy: There’s been some big changes in my company actually. They’ve hired a black female CEO recently and there’s already been so many positive changes. I’m looking forward to seeing what new ways the company will work to promote equity in the future. And you Wren? You’re still at the same job, right?\nWren: I am! I’ve been there about five years now which seems crazy! Things are pretty steady at work but a few months ago I started a non-profit organization that helps to provide internships and mentorship for women in tech. I’m so excited to be able to help a new generation of women find their passion in this field. What about yourself Jude? Anything exciting happening at the archives?\nJude: That’s so inspiring Wren, you’re going to make such a difference for so many young women. We just received a large grant from the government to work towards truth and reconciliation. I’m really excited to work with the local Indigenous communities to find a way to improve the archives. On a similar note, I’m also acting as a consultant for Dante in establishing digital literacy programming. The podcasting initiative at Ava’s school was so successful and in demand from the students that the school was given a large grant by the province to set up more technical infrastructure. Donations from readers on my blog didn’t hurt either. We are going to draw from our experiences setting up that programming to address access issues in Iqaluit.\nDante: Looks like things are going well all around, it’s been a crazy few years but I’m so glad we all met! Cheers to many more years!\n[Glasses clink together in a sunlit shot with the mountains in the background in a Polaroid-perfect moment]"
