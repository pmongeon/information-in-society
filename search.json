As we will see in this chapter, information management degrees are about a lot more than librarianship and can provide you with many opportunities.

ALA-accredited degrees are generally a requirement for a range of positions in libraries of all kinds and other related organizations. Accordingly, most students reading this chapter are likely to be interested in pursuing a career in librarianship. Many of you, however, are in this program with completely different careers in mind, and you may be surprised by the emphasis on libraries. Perhaps some of you just have no prior thoughts about the program or the field as you are taking this course as an elective, or simply because you ended up here randomly. Whatever group you might find yourself in, now that you are here you might be surprised by the breadth of the discipline and the many professional pathways that it can lead you down. Who knows, maybe you joined the program to be a children services librarian, and will come out of it an aspiring data scientist? So, what are the information professions? Marcia Bates (2015) referred to our discipline as a meta-discipline that spans across the entire spectrum of traditional research disciplines, from the Arts and Humanities to the Natural Science. While it is by no means comprehensive, this figure from Bates (2015) was an attempt to illustrate the breath of the discipline by situating many of the sub-disciplines across that spectrum.\nThe diversity of the information profession can also be observed through the many job titles that the MLIS jobs report shows.\nThis degree does not just lead to librarianship or working as an archivist, in fact there are many different job titles that an MI can lead to.

    "text": "1.3 Skills to succeed as an information professional\nAlthough we will narrow in on a few different career options in the following sections, there are some core skills that have been mentioned as valuable regardless of the direction you choose. San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management. You can learn more about the different roles, job duties you may encounter and the skills you will need to be successful. There is also more information on the professional values of each sector and the professional associations that you may be able to join."

    "section": "1.4 Public Librarianship",
    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

These include but are not limited to access and reference services librarian, outreach and diversity librarian, materials and image librarian, and staff engagement liaison. Although there are so many different titles within academic librarianship there are some job duties that appear often. These include reference assistance, assisting faculty in research and teaching research, delivering courses on research, creating LibGuides, helping to select which journals to purchase, analyzing usage statistics and outreach and marketing (MLIS Skills at Work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.2 Skills\nThere are some skills that you should be working on if you are looking to work within an academic library. These include knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet and data applications, knowledge of the open access movement and the scholarly publishing industry, multitasking, interpersonal skills, customer service and knowledge of copyright practices (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.3 Professional values\nWhen it comes to professional values, academic librarianship has very similar values to public librarianship such as access, diversity, preservation, education and privacy (Core values of librarianship, 2019).\n\n\n1.5.4 Professional Associations\nLibrary associations are formed so that librarians with similar interests can come together to share ideas. Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\n1.5.5 Special Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\n1.5.6 Jobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.7 Skills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

You may end up as a medical content reference librarian, a medical research librarian, or a health sciences librarian. Some job duties you may encounter in health librarianship include creating search acquisition strategies, keyword searches, managing SEO campaigns, packaging research data into insightful deliverables and planning, promoting and administering library services and resources (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.2 Skills\nSome skills that are important for those working in this field include research and analysis skills, project management skills, the ability to prioritize and multitask, excellent oral and written skills, and being proficient at searching online databases (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.3 Professional Values\nThe Special Library Association states on their website that the core professional values of special librarianship are leadership, service, results and accountability, collaboration and partnering and innovation and continuous learning (Abram, 2019).\n\n\n1.6.4 Professional Associations\nThere are also professional associations related to special libraries. For example, there is the Special Libraries Association. There are also associations dedicated specifically to health librarianship including the Canadian Health Libraries Association and the Medical Library Association. And associations for law librarianship including the American Association of Law Libraries and the Canadian Association of Law Libraries.\n\n\n1.6.5 Data Management\n\n\n1.6.6 Jobs\nThere are so many different jobs in the data management field. Some sample job titles include Data analytics manager, data librarian, data visualization and GIS specialist, and manager of data governance. Some duties you may encounter within these roles include leading a university library’s research data services initiative, partnering with researchers to advance the knowledge and management of data, or answering questions on data management for faculty and staff at a university (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.7 Skills\nSome of the skills that you may need to work in data management include experience working with complicated datasets, knowledge of data software such as tableau, and an understanding of information management practices such as carrying out data needs assessments (MLIS skills at work, 2022). If you have a passion for data, consider tailoring your courses to working with data. Courses such as data science and data management will help you to learn the skills you need to succeed. Digital librarianship Jobs With the world shifting towards more online content, digitization is becoming more and more important making digital librarianship is a worthwhile field of librarianship to pursue. Digital librarianship can have many different job titles including digital collections manager, electronic resources librarian, virtual resources librarian or digital and automated services librarian. When working in digital librarianship you may find yourself supervising activities related to the digitization of collections, providing consultation and technical support for the development of technology reliant research projects or engaging in the assessment, maintenance and enhancement of digital collections and services (MLIS skills at work, 2022). Skills If you are interested in digital librarianship, it could be helpful to take extra advanced technology courses during your degree. This will help you to gain the skills you need for the field such as ability to learn new technologies quickly, experience with metadata, knowledge of digitization standards and an interest in electronic information sources and organizations (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nStephanie Bilodeau\nManager, Open Government and Data Governance\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police – IM/IT Program\nStephanie wears two hats with her job at the RCMP, she is the manager of Open Government and the manager of Data Governance. There is a big need for these positions because programmers created systems to store data but more needs to be done to organize and manage that data. They have found that when using these systems things aren’t accurate, queries are not always pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech focused so it’s important to know how information is managed through IT systems. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.\nThe Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired to a government position. They offer full time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also have the ability to bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html\nThe best advice Stephanie would give is to be open minded and willing to learn constantly. Always try new things and make sure that the work you are doing is aligned with your organizations’ mission and corporate vision."

Some of the roles that fall under knowledge management include knowledge synthesizer, knowledge analyst, knowledge navigator and of course knowledge manager. Some of the main duties you may encounter within this field are handling a company’s knowledge management operations, formulating a knowledge management strategy, managing knowledge management staff and influencing change within an organization. Tasks you may be asked to perform include curating technical website content, designing and implementing effective learning activities and managing knowledge sharing events (Postolache, 2019). Skills If you are looking to become a knowledge manager it is possible to obtain a knowledge management certificate on top of your degree to increase your chances of employment (Postolache, 2019).\n\n\n1.7.2 Professional Values\n????????????????????\n\n\n1.7.3 Professional Associations\n????????????????????\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nTrecia enrolled in the MLIS program at McGill University and specialized in knowledge management to learn how to best share knowledge. During her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their business information center, and she learned that efficient knowledge sharing strategies rely on a good understanding of your audience. Knowledge management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and you must constantly re-evaluate to make sure that the collected resources are useful for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now a community services librarian managing the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the Books-by-Mail service. Her job involves public relations and communications, outreach, and programming. One of her main focuses is community led programming, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that best fits their communities’ needs. She finds that programming works best when there is a commitment from the community to participate. Community led programming begins with conversations with patrons to try to determine what programs they would like to see. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, a lot of important skills are required of a successful community services librarian. Communication is important, especially formal communication, everything from social media etiquette to doing media press releases. You need to be able to speak with media outlets as a representative of the library at public tables. Management and leadership skills are also necessary along with time management, project management and knowledge management. Public speaking skills are necessary as you would be giving presentations and teaching staff, as well as running public workshops and programs. Experience with research and report writing is also an asset.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information, the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.9 Archives\n\n1.9.1 Jobs\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian. Some job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public (MLIS skills at work, 2022)\n\n\n1.9.2 Skills\nSome skills you may need to work in these positions include an ability to work independently as well as in a group, knowledge of intellectual property issues, and knowledge of standards of archival description and bibliographic control (MLIS Skills at work, 2022). Dalhousie offers courses in archives that will provide you with the skills you need to be successful in your career such as Archives 1 and 2. You are also able to complete a work practicum or internship within an archive to gain direct experience.\n\n\n1.9.3 Professional values\nSome of the core values of archivists include access and use, accountability, advocacy, diversity, history and memory, preservation, responsible stewardship, selection, service, social responsibility, and sustainability. If you want to learn more about these core values which were published the Society of American Archivists, take a look at their website (Society of American Archivists, 2020).\n\n\n1.9.4 Professional associations\nIf you are looking to join any professional associations for archivists there is the Association of Canadian Archivists, along with the Canadian Council of Archives. Each province also has its own council or association. Nova Scotia has the Council of Nova Scotia Archives. Click on the links to learn more about each association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor Council of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access. Sharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current. Sharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented. The best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

ALA-accredited degrees are generally a requirement for a range of positions in libraries of all kinds and other related organizations. Accordingly, most students reading this chapter are likely to be interested in pursuing a career in librarianship. Many of you, however, are in this program with completely different careers in mind, and you may be surprised by the emphasis on libraries. Perhaps some of you just have no prior thoughts about the program or the field as you are taking this course as an elective, or simply because you ended up here randomly. Whatever group you might find yourself in, now that you are here you might be surprised by the breadth of the discipline and the many professional pathways that it can lead you down. Who knows, maybe you joined the program to be a children services librarian, and will come out of it an aspiring data scientist? So, what are the information professions? Marcia Bates (2015) referred to our discipline as a meta-discipline that spans across the entire spectrum of traditional research disciplines, from the Arts and Humanities to the Natural Science. While it is by no means comprehensive, this figure from Bates (2015) was an attempt to illustrate the breath of the discipline by situating many of the sub-disciplines across that spectrum.\nThe diversity of the information profession can also be observed through the many job titles that the MLIS jobs report shows.\nThis degree does not just lead to librarianship or working as an archivist, in fact there are many different job titles that an MI can lead to. The following is a diverse list of job titles that you may find when looking for work in the MI field. Why don’t you take a look through these titles and see if any of them interest you, and then do a little bit of research to learn more?"

    "text": "1.3 Skills to succeed as an information professional\nAlthough we will narrow in on a few different career options in the following sections, there are some core skills that have been mentioned as valuable regardless of the direction you choose. San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management. You can learn more about the different roles, job duties you may encounter and the skills you will need to be successful. There is also more information on the professional values of each sector and the professional associations that you may be able to join."

    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

These include but are not limited to access and reference services librarian, outreach and diversity librarian, materials and image librarian, and staff engagement liaison. Although there are so many different titles within academic librarianship there are some job duties that appear often. These include reference assistance, assisting faculty in research and teaching research, delivering courses on research, creating LibGuides, helping to select which journals to purchase, analyzing usage statistics and outreach and marketing (MLIS Skills at Work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.2 Skills\nThere are some skills that you should be working on if you are looking to work within an academic library. These include knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet and data applications, knowledge of the open access movement and the scholarly publishing industry, multitasking, interpersonal skills, customer service and knowledge of copyright practices (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.3 Professional values\nWhen it comes to professional values, academic librarianship has very similar values to public librarianship such as access, diversity, preservation, education and privacy (Core values of librarianship, 2019).\n\n\n1.5.4 Professional Associations\nLibrary associations are formed so that librarians with similar interests can come together to share ideas. Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\n1.5.5 Special Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\n1.5.6 Jobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.7 Skills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

For example, there is the Special Libraries Association. There are also associations dedicated specifically to health librarianship including the Canadian Health Libraries Association and the Medical Library Association. And associations for law librarianship including the American Association of Law Libraries and the Canadian Association of Law Libraries.\n\n\n1.6.5 Data Management\n\n\n1.6.6 Jobs\nThere are so many different jobs in the data management field. Some sample job titles include Data analytics manager, data librarian, data visualization and GIS specialist, and manager of data governance. Some duties you may encounter within these roles include leading a university library’s research data services initiative, partnering with researchers to advance the knowledge and management of data, or answering questions on data management for faculty and staff at a university (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.7 Skills\nSome of the skills that you may need to work in data management include experience working with complicated datasets, knowledge of data software such as tableau, and an understanding of information management practices such as carrying out data needs assessments (MLIS skills at work, 2022).

Digital librarianship Jobs With the world shifting towards more online content, digitization is becoming more and more important making digital librarianship is a worthwhile field of librarianship to pursue. Digital librarianship can have many different job titles including digital collections manager, electronic resources librarian, virtual resources librarian or digital and automated services librarian. When working in digital librarianship you may find yourself supervising activities related to the digitization of collections, providing consultation and technical support for the development of technology reliant research projects or engaging in the assessment, maintenance and enhancement of digital collections and services (MLIS skills at work, 2022). Skills If you are interested in digital librarianship, it could be helpful to take extra advanced technology courses during your degree. This will help you to gain the skills you need for the field such as ability to learn new technologies quickly, experience with metadata, knowledge of digitization standards and an interest in electronic information sources and organizations (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nStephanie Bilodeau\nManager, Open Government and Data Governance\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police – IM/IT Program\nStephanie wears two hats with her job at the RCMP, she is the manager of Open Government and the manager of Data Governance. There is a big need for these positions because programmers created systems to store data but more needs to be done to organize and manage that data. They have found that when using these systems things aren’t accurate, queries are not always pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech focused so it’s important to know how information is managed through IT systems. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.\nThe Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired to a government position. They offer full time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also have the ability to bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html\nThe best advice Stephanie would give is to be open minded and willing to learn constantly. Always try new things and make sure that the work you are doing is aligned with your organizations’ mission and corporate vision."

Skills If you are looking to become a knowledge manager it is possible to obtain a knowledge management certificate on top of your degree to increase your chances of employment (Postolache, 2019).\n\n\n1.7.2 Professional Values\n????????????????????\n\n\n1.7.3 Professional Associations\n????????????????????\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nTrecia enrolled in the MLIS program at McGill University and specialized in knowledge management to learn how to best share knowledge. During her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their business information center, and she learned that efficient knowledge sharing strategies rely on a good understanding of your audience. Knowledge management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and you must constantly re-evaluate to make sure that the collected resources are useful for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now a community services librarian managing the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the Books-by-Mail service. Her job involves public relations and communications, outreach, and programming. One of her main focuses is community led programming, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that best fits their communities’ needs. She finds that programming works best when there is a commitment from the community to participate. Community led programming begins with conversations with patrons to try to determine what programs they would like to see. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, a lot of important skills are required of a successful community services librarian. Communication is important, especially formal communication, everything from social media etiquette to doing media press releases. You need to be able to speak with media outlets as a representative of the library at public tables. Management and leadership skills are also necessary along with time management, project management and knowledge management. Public speaking skills are necessary as you would be giving presentations and teaching staff, as well as running public workshops and programs. Experience with research and report writing is also an asset.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information, the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.9 Archives\n\n1.9.1 Jobs\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian. Some job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public (MLIS skills at work, 2022)\n\n\n1.9.2 Skills\nSome skills you may need to work in these positions include an ability to work independently as well as in a group, knowledge of intellectual property issues, and knowledge of standards of archival description and bibliographic control (MLIS Skills at work, 2022). Dalhousie offers courses in archives that will provide you with the skills you need to be successful in your career such as Archives 1 and 2. You are also able to complete a work practicum or internship within an archive to gain direct experience.\n\n\n1.9.3 Professional values\nSome of the core values of archivists include access and use, accountability, advocacy, diversity, history and memory, preservation, responsible stewardship, selection, service, social responsibility, and sustainability. If you want to learn more about these core values which were published the Society of American Archivists, take a look at their website (Society of American Archivists, 2020).\n\n\n1.9.4 Professional associations\nIf you are looking to join any professional associations for archivists there is the Association of Canadian Archivists, along with the Canadian Council of Archives. Each province also has its own council or association. Nova Scotia has the Council of Nova Scotia Archives. Click on the links to learn more about each association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor Council of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access. Sharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current. Sharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented. The best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management.

    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

These include but are not limited to access and reference services librarian, outreach and diversity librarian, materials and image librarian, and staff engagement liaison. Although there are so many different titles within academic librarianship there are some job duties that appear often. These include reference assistance, assisting faculty in research and teaching research, delivering courses on research, creating LibGuides, helping to select which journals to purchase, analyzing usage statistics and outreach and marketing (MLIS Skills at Work, 2022).\n\n\nSkills\nThere are some skills that you should be working on if you are looking to work within an academic library. These include knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet and data applications, knowledge of the open access movement and the scholarly publishing industry, multitasking, interpersonal skills, customer service and knowledge of copyright practices (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\nProfessional values\nWhen it comes to professional values, academic librarianship has very similar values to public librarianship such as access, diversity, preservation, education and privacy (Core values of librarianship, 2019).\n\n\nProfessional Associations\nLibrary associations are formed so that librarians with similar interests can come together to share ideas. Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\nSpecial Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\nJobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\nSkills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

Some of the roles that fall under knowledge management include knowledge synthesizer, knowledge analyst, knowledge navigator and of course knowledge manager. Some of the main duties you may encounter within this field are handling a company’s knowledge management operations, formulating a knowledge management strategy, managing knowledge management staff and influencing change within an organization.

During the final term of her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their International Intellectual Properties Division, and there she learned that effective knowledge gathering and sharing strategies rely on a sound understanding of your audiences. Knowledge Management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and constantly re-evaluating knowledge purpose and use to ensure that the collected resources are of value for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now the Community Services Librarian, and Managing Branch Librarian of the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the regional Borrow-by-Mail service. In addition, her job portfolio covers the regional areas of responsibilities for Public Relations and Communications, Programming, Outreach, and Services for Adults. One of her main focuses is developing Community-Led programs and services, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that is responsive to their communities' needs. She finds that programming works best when there is engagement with the community to participate. Community-Led programming begins with conversations with the community-at-large and other community service providers to try to determine programs and services of interest and value. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, some important skills required of a successful public librarians and public library staff include communication and leadership. Communication is critically important, especially formal communication skills such as being comfortable with public speaking (to give presentations and leading workshops), understanding the evolving social media etiquette, to crafting effective media releases and grant applications (and reports). Management and leadership skills, along with solid project management experience are key to creating a healthy, responsive, and thriving workplace environment.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information - the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.7 Archives\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian.\nWhile archives and libraries have many points in common, they have important difference that often sets them apart as clearly distinct fields. Archival records are very different than bibliographic records. They tend to be created and maintained for different purposes, and guided by a different set of principles and philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nThe School of Information Management offers several archives courses and a an archives certificate that you can complete as part of your MI degree. There are also practicum and internship opportunities available for you to gain experience.\n\n\nSome job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public. To get more information about the archives field, you can check out the websites of the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Canadian Council of Archives, and the Council of Nova Scotia Archives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor\nCouncil of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access.\nSharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current.\nSharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented.\nThe best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\nThere are many professional associations for you to check out if you are interested in public libraries, such as the Public Library Association (a division of the American Library Association), the Nova Scotia Library Association (free membership for students).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professionals\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents.\nThe Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles.\nThere are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way.\nOne piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management.\nSome of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling.\nThere are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions.\nIf looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to.\nWhile you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for.\nThe best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant.

Depending on the type of museum, these libraries and archives can be part of the collections, or exist to support the museums activities. For example, a good exhibit might rely on having done research on the topic and its social or historical context, or on specific items that are part of the exhibit. Then you can think of museums as just another type of organization where librarian or archivists are needed.\nAnother key role for information professionals in museums involves dealing with information systems and users. Museums increasingly have online collections and databases to support them. These require a set of competencies and skills, such as database management, organization of information, and user-centered web design, that you will be able to develop during your MI degree.\nMore generally, the close relationship between the information and museum fields may be blurry enough that your information degree could help you compete for any type of museum role. especially if you have a background in the arts and humanities, or another area that is relevant for a particular museum.\nTo get a better sense of the jobs available in the museum space, check out the Canadian Museums Association (https://museums.ca/) and their job board."

There are also practicum and internship opportunities available for you to gain experience.\nTo get more information about the archives field, you can check out the websites of the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Canadian Council of Archives, and the Council of Nova Scotia Archives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor\nCouncil of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access.\nSharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current.\nSharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented.\nThe best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

The following are examples of core values in the information profession, adapted from Gorman (2015).

    "section": "2.2 Introduction",
    "text": "2.2 Introduction\nAs we probably all were taught to do when seeking to understand the meaning of a term, let us first turn to a dictionary to obtain a definition of the term \"information\". Here are the definitions offered by the Merriam Webster Dictionary:\n\nKnowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction\nIntelligence, News\nFacts, data\nThe attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something (such as nucleotides in DNA or binary digits in a computer program) that produce specific effects\nA signal or character (as in a communication system or computer) representing data\nSomething (such as a message, experimental data, or a picture) which justifies change in a construct (such as a plan or theory) that represents physical or mental experience or another construct\nA quantitative measure of the content of information\nSpecifically: a numerical quantity that measures the uncertainty in the outcome of an experiment to be performed\nThe communication or reception of knowledge or intelligence\nThe act of informing against a person\nA formal accusation of a crime made by a prosecuting officer as distinguished from an indictment presented by a grand jury\n\n\n2.2.1 A definition of information for the information field\nWhatever name the schools or programs that train information professionals are called (e.g., Information Management, Information Studies, Information Science), most have in common that one word: \"information\". It is thus no surprise that at least a handful of scholars working in these schools or departments have sought to provide some conceptual clarity regarding that word that unites us all. What may be more surprising, however, is that several decades of scholarship and debates have not been successful at achieving a consensus on the definition of information. Still, these conceptual explorations have generated many attempts at such a definition leading us to explore more thoroughly a range of other concepts that are related to it and that have sometimes been used to determine what is (and what is not) information. They have also generated quite an entertaining debate between two scholars, Birger Hjorland, and Marcia Bates, who had very different views on what information was, and what it meant to our field. At the core of their dispute was whether information is to be understood as an objective or subjective phenomenon.\n\n2.2.1.1 The Bates-Hjorland debate\nMarcia Bates believed that all information is natural and exists in the material world of matter and energy and that \"almost anything existing in the universe, that can come into human and other animals' purview, can be experienced as information\" (Bates, 2006, p. 1033). From there, she came up with a glossary of information types:\n\nEmbedded information: information left behind on earth by animals. Includes such things as human created tools, or paths through the woods.\nEncoded information: Natural information that is organized symbolically, linguistically, or is signal based.\nEmbodied information: The corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form.\nExosomatic information: Information that is stored outside of the body.\nExpressed information: The ways in which members of a species communicate including language, scents, calls and gestures.\nKnowledge: Information that has been integrated with other contents of understanding and therefore given meaning.\nRecorded information: Information that has been stored in a durable medium (both communicatory and memorial information). For example, books.\nTrace information: The information that remains after a species is done with it. For example, a no-longer-used wasps' nest.\n\nMany of these definitions are intertwined with each other. For example, all of the knowledge that a person has stored in their memory is encoded in the neural pathways in their brain. The way that life is experienced and remembered is embodied in the degree of consciousness that the person has (Bates, 2006).\nWhile Bates had many definitions for information two of her most debated definitions included information 1 and information 2."

    "section": "2.3 Information: Objective or Subjective?",
    "text": "2.3 Information: Objective or Subjective?\nAccording to Hjørland (2007) There are two basic views of information:\n\nObjective information: information is any difference in patterns of matter and energy\nSubjective/situational information: information is a difference that makes a differnence\n\nLet's look at an example of information 1. Someone waving their hands towards themselves is often culturally construed to mean \"come here\". Although there are situations where someone may not understand this gesture in this way, with Bates' definition it is still considered an objective phenomenon. The movement remains information regardless of whether it is seen or even interpreted (Hjørland, 2007).\nInformation 2 is described as \"some pattern or organization of matter and energy given meaning by a living being\" (Hjørland, 2007, p.1450). The idea that words only have meaning situationally and temporarily coincides with this definition of information but not with information 1. One problem with this definition is that it does not consider how computers also process information not just living beings. Information in computers is not objective because programmers give meaning to the strings of numbers (Hjørland, 2007).\nBirger Hjørland believes that Bates' theory of information is both inadequate and inappropriate for information science. She believes that Bates is trying to have it all by defining information in more than one way. Next let's look at Hjørland's definition of information.\nWhat one person considers information may not be considered information to another person or in another situation. Researchers from different fields will look at the world from different perspectives and will process information through different lenses (Hjørland, 2007).\n\n2.3.1 So, when is information not information?\nIf no one is aware of an object than it cannot be information, it can become information once someone becomes aware of it. Under the situational definition of information, whether or not something is information depends on the circumstances surrounding the document, data, object or event. These things may be defined as information in certain situations but not in others. This idea becomes complicated when you think of how vast the range of information can be, determining if something is informative very difficult. Think of an example of a tree, which can be informative in more than one way. It will represent other trees of its kind, but also the rings inside the trunk provide information about weather patterns. Hjørland states that \"we are unable to say confidently of anything that it could not be information\" (Hjørland, 2007, p. 1451) meaning that everything may well be information.\n\n\n2.3.2 Document\n\n2.3.2.1 Information as a thing\nMichael Buckland describes information in three ways; information-as-thing, information-as-knowledge and information-as-process. Information can be thought of as a thing when it is used to describe an object such as data or documents. They are considered information because they are informative, they impart knowledge or communicate information. Information systems deal directly with information-as-thing; libraries with books, museums with objects.\nWhat then is informative? You can be informed by many different things, in fact pretty much everything around you can be informative including messages, documents objects and events. Brookes (pg. 14, 1979) states that \"the primary source of information is not the literature of the sciences but the observation of the relevant natural phenomena\" (Hjørland, 2007).\n\n\n2.3.2.2 What is a document?\nWith the increase in publications in the late 19th century more techniques were needed to keep track of all of the documents being produced. It was around the early 20th century when the word documentation was adopted to describe this practice. Since then, there has long been a debate around what exactly qualifies as a document. The question is whether the meaning of document should be limited to just texts and printed texts. If the word document can describe a text that is not printed who's to say it can't also describe things that are not texts at all. Throughout the years many different academics have published their ideas on what is and is not a document. In 1934 Paul Otlet wrote in Traité de documentation that \"objects themselves can be regarded as documents if you are informed by observation of them\" (pg. 805). Soon after, in 1935 Walter Schurmeyer stated that a document is any material that is used to extend our knowledge. Similarly, the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation defined a document as \"any source of information, in material form, capable of being used for reference or study or as an authority\" (pg. 805). They include in this definition manuscripts, illustrations and museum specimens among other things (Buckland, 1997).\nSuzanne Briet was involved in the debate for many years, and she defines a document as \"any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon\" (pg. 806). She is well known for her example of an antelope as a document. She discusses how an antelope that is living free in Africa would not be considered a document but once it is captured and put into a zoo it becomes an object of study. At that point it becomes a document as it is now physical evidence used by researchers. Based on this reasoning she describes six objects and determines whether or not they are a document:\nAlthough Briet's rules for determining whether or not an object is a document are not abundantly clear, there are some rules that can be inferred:\n\nA document is physical,\n\n\n\nA document is intentional intentionality; the objects are intended to be treated as evidence.\n\n\n\nThe objects must be processed to be made into documents.\n\n\n\nThe object must be perceived as a document.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 What is an archive?\nArchives have different meanings to different academics (Caswell, 2016). In humanities studies \"the archive denotes a hypothetical wonderland, the first law of what can be said, the system that governs of the appearance of statements as unique events\" (Caswell, 2016, pg. 1?) An archive is historically understood to be passively engaged with the documentation and preservation processes (Fitzgerald et al). Verne Harris does not believe that archives actually reflect reality but only provide a small snapshot of historical events. She states that \"the archival record is but a sliver of social memory (Harris, 2002, Pg. 64). She believes that archives as shaped by the people who create them, the archivists who preserve and make them available and the researchers who use them (Harris, 2002).\nIf information is considered knowledge, then it must be intangible – it cannot be touched or measured (Buckland, 1991).\nInformation as a process occurs when someone is informed of something, changing what they know (Buckland, 1991)."

Here are the definitions offered by the Merriam Webster Dictionary:\n\nKnowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction\nIntelligence, News\nFacts, data\nThe attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something (such as nucleotides in DNA or binary digits in a computer program) that produce specific effects\nA signal or character (as in a communication system or computer) representing data\nSomething (such as a message, experimental data, or a picture) which justifies change in a construct (such as a plan or theory) that represents physical or mental experience or another construct\nA quantitative measure of the content of information\nSpecifically: a numerical quantity that measures the uncertainty in the outcome of an experiment to be performed\nThe communication or reception of knowledge or intelligence\nThe act of informing against a person\nA formal accusation of a crime made by a prosecuting officer as distinguished from an indictment presented by a grand jury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nThink of the 10 words you came up with earlier.\n\nTo which of the 11 definitions above are your 10 words most strongly related?\nWhich of the 11 definitions do you think are relevant to our field? Which do you think are not?\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Situating information in its disciplinary contexts\nOne of the things that you may have noticed with the dictionary definitions is that some of them are unrelated to the information profession as you may now think of them after reading the previous chapter and attending the first class. Indeed, one of the main issue with the word “information” is that it is used in a wide variety of contexts or disciplines, and the meaning of the word often depends on that context or discipline. What then would be the specific understanding of information that are most useful for information management? The figure below is a network showing the links between disciplines represented by a large circle and the most frequent keywords containing the word “information” that research publications in these disciplines contain. our field is represented by the orange circle labeled “LIS” (for Library and Information Science).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of this map? Were you able to observe clear disciplinary difference in the use of the term “information”?\nDid the terms linked to the LIS field make sense to you based on what you know about the field? Were some of them surprising?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 A definition of information for the information field?\nWhatever name the schools or programs that train information professionals are called (e.g., Information Management, Information Studies, Information Science), most have in common that one word: \"information\". It is thus no surprise that at least a handful of scholars working in these schools or departments have sought to provide some conceptual clarity regarding that word that unites us all. What may be more surprising, however, is that several decades of scholarship and debates have not been successful at achieving a consensus on the definition of the word information. Still, these conceptual explorations have generated many attempts at such a definition leading us to explore more thoroughly a range of other concepts that are related to it and that have sometimes been used to determine what is (and what is not) information. They have also generated entertaining debates, such as the well-known discussion between Birger Hjørland and Marcia Bates on whether or not an understanding of information as an objective phenomenon is useful for the field. In the next section, we provide an overview of how three scholars of the information disciplines have proposed that we should think about the term information: Marcia Bates, Birger Hjørland, and Michael Buckland (who most of you got acquainted with in week 1 of the organization of information course).\n\n\n2.2.3 Fundamental forms of information\nMarcia Bates believed that all information is natural and exists in the material world of matter and energy and that \"almost anything existing in the universe, that can come into human and other animals' purview, can be experienced as information\" (Bates 2006, 1033). From there, she constructed a glossary of the different forms of information:\n\nEmbedded information: Information left behind on earth by animals. Includes such things as human created tools, or paths through the woods.\nEmbodied information: The corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form.\nEncoded information: Natural information that is organized symbolically, linguistically, or is signal based.\nEnacted information: The pattern of organization of actions of an animal in, and interacting with, is environment, utilizing capabilities and experience from its neural stores.\nExperienced information: The pattern of organization of subjective experience, the feeling of being in life, of an animal.\nExosomatic information: Information that is stored outside of the body.\nExpressed information: The pattern of organization of communicatory scents, calls, gestures, and ultimately, human spoken language used to communicate among members of a species and between species.\nGenetic information: Information contained in the genotype\nGenotype: The genetic constitution of a living thing.\nInformation 1: The pattern of organization of matter and energy\nInformation 2: Some pattern of organization of matter and energy given meaning by a living being.\nKnowledge: Information that has been integrated with other contents of understanding and therefore given meaning.\nNeural-cultural information: Information that has been created by, processed in, or disseminated from animal nervous systems, especially human nervous systems. (Neural information may also be used for lower animals and/or specifically for the nervous system structures that make memory and action possible in general in animals and humans.)\nPhenotype: The genetically and environmentally determined embodiment of a genotype.\nRecorded information: Information that has been stored in a durable medium.\nRepresented information: Natural information that is encoded or embodied.\nTrace information: The information that remains after a species is done with it. For example, a no-longer-used wasps' nest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to read more about the fundamental forms of information and their relevance for the information field according to Marcia Bates, you can read the full article:\nBates, Marcia J. 2006. \"Fundamental Forms of Information.\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 57 (8): 10331045. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20369.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Information: Objective or Subjective?\nAccording to Hjørland (2007) There are two basic views of information:\n\nObjective information: information is any difference (in patterns of matter and energy, as in Bates’ concept of information 1)\nSubjective/situational information: information is a difference that makes a difference\n\nIn his paper, @hjorland_information_2007 criticizes Bates’ fundamental form of information and argues that only subjective information is relevant to the field, and while Bates’ concept of information 2 is compatible with that view, the concept of information 1 is not and, according to Hjørland (2007), should be ignored. Hjørland also argues that Bates’ definition of information 2 is too limited because it does not consider how computers process information, and because the 0s and 1s (the patterns of matter and energy) that computers process are not information in themselves because their interpretation depends on the computer program (what the programmer programmed the strings to represent).\n\n\n2.2.5 So, when is information not information?\nIf no one is aware of an object than it cannot be information, it can become information once someone becomes aware of it. Under the situational definition of information, whether or not something is information depends on the circumstances surrounding the document, data, object or event. These things may be defined as information in certain situations but not in others. This idea becomes complicated when you think of how vast the range of information can be, determining if something is informative very difficult. Think of an example of a tree, which can be informative in more than one way. It will represent other trees of its kind, but also the rings inside the trunk provide information about weather patterns. Hjørland states that \"we are unable to say confidently of anything that it could not be information\" (Hjørland, 2007, p. 1451) meaning that everything may well be information.\n\n\n2.2.6 Document\n\n2.2.6.1 Information as a thing\nMichael Buckland describes information in three ways; information-as-thing, information-as-knowledge and information-as-process.

    "text": "2.5 Data, information, knowledge, and wisdom\nThe wisdom hierarchy is an important part of information sciences. The hierarchy (pictured below) is often described in the form of a pyramid with data on the bottom followed by information, knowledge and wisdom. Many authors agree that the first appearance of the hierarchy was in T.S. Elliot’s poem The Rock.\n\n“Where is the wisdom that we have lost in knowledge?\nWhere is the knowledge that we have lost in information?”\n\nThe hierarchy is used to connect wisdom, knowledge, information and data to one another and to identify how entities at the lower levels transform into the higher levels. The assumption is that the lower-level entities can be used to create the higher-level entities. Under this assumption it would follow that data creates information, information creates knowledge and knowledge creates wisdom. There is not full consensus on the meanings of each section of the pyramid, for example, some authors believe that information and knowledge are the same thing. Bellinger believes that understanding should never be a level of the pyramid and instead is what helps the transition between levels (Rowley, 2007).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) pyramid\n\n\nOne of the more well-known researchers of the Wisdom Hierarchy is Ackoff. Ackoff includes the common elements of the hierarchy in his definition along with an extra level which he calls understanding. The following are Ackoff’s definitions of the hierarchy.\n\nData: symbols representing the properties of events, objects and the environment. It is of no use until it is processed into a relevant form. Data tend to be products of information.\nInformation: information is what is inferred from data. It is contained in the answers to the questions beginning with who, what, where, when and how many.\nKnowledge: is know how. It “is what makes possible the transformation of information into instructions” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2006).\nIntelligence: “the ability to increase efficiency” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2007).\nWisdom: “the ability to increase effectiveness” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2007).\n\nAlthough there are some discrepancies in the definitions of the key elements there are some common elements that show up in many of the definitions.\nMost definitions of data are written in terms of what data lacks. They agree that there is no meaning or value to data because it has no context. They also agree that data is unorganized and unprocessed, it is discrete objects, facts or observations. Another common idea is that data is recorded descriptions of things, events, activities, or transactions (Rowley, 2007).\nCommon words to describe information include format, structure, organization, meaning and value. Many definitions describe information in terms of data. A few other common definitions include:\nInformation is:\n\nFormatted data\nData that makes a subject more understandable\nData that has become meaningful and useful to humans\nOrganized data that now has meaning\nData processed for a purpose\n\nKnowledge has many definitions by different researchers, there is not nearly as much consensus on the definition. Barnes stated that “knowledge is information processed in the mind of an individual” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007) whereas Choo states that “information becomes knowledge through the process of belief structuring or the formation of justified, true beliefs about the world” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007). If you were to summarize the most common definitions you would find that knowledge can be viewed as a mix of many things including information, understanding, capability, experience, skills and value.\nMany of the authors within information science believe that they are not capable of defining wisdom (Rowley, 2007)."

They are considered information because they are informative, they impart knowledge or communicate information. Pretty much everything around you can be informative, which is problematic for information professionals. Indeed, the information systems that we manage deal directly with information-as-thing and since we cannot deal with everything in the world, we need at some point to make decisions as to what kinds of information-as-thing we choose to engage with. The term document may be useful here. According to Briet (1951), a document is “any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon”. She is well known for her example of an antelope as a document. She discusses how an antelope that is living free in Africa would not be considered a document but once it is captured and put into a zoo it becomes an object of study. At that point it becomes a document as it is now physical evidence used by researchers.

This is one of main contribution of the wisdom hierarchy (pictured below), which is often described in the form of a pyramid with data on the bottom followed by information, knowledge and wisdom.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

According to the pyramid, data generates information, information generates knowledge and knowledge generates wisdom. However, just as defining information has proven quite challenging, there is no consensus on the definition of each level of the pyramid, no consensus regarding the number of layers that the pyramid should have, and no consensus regarding the hierarchical nature of the relationship between the concepts. (Rowley 2007).\n\n2.5.0.1 Data\nMost definitions of data are written in terms of what data lacks. They agree that there is no meaning or value to data because it has no context. They also agree that data is unorganized and unprocessed, it is discrete objects, facts or observations. Another common idea is that data is recorded descriptions of things, events, activities, or transactions (Rowley, 2007).\nCommon words to describe information include format, structure, organization, meaning and value. Many definitions describe information in terms of data. A few other common definitions include:\nInformation is:\n\nFormatted data\nData that makes a subject more understandable\nData that has become meaningful and useful to humans\nOrganized data that now has meaning\nData processed for a purpose\n\nKnowledge has many definitions by different researchers, there is not nearly as much consensus on the definition. Barnes stated that “knowledge is information processed in the mind of an individual” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007) whereas Choo states that “information becomes knowledge through the process of belief structuring or the formation of justified, true beliefs about the world” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007). If you were to summarize the most common definitions you would find that knowledge can be viewed as a mix of many things including information, understanding, capability, experience, skills and value."

    "text": "3.2 The information society\nThe information society is a band from the 1980s, but it is also a type of society that succeeds the industrial society and in which information plays a dominant role. Theorists of the information society have focused on five dimensions of the information society (Webster 2014):\nThe technological dimension of the information society is reflected in the growth of information technologies such as personal computers, smartphones, and the internet, which are now ubiquitous. The economic dimension of the information society emphasizes the dominance of information and knowledge industries and the increased share of countries’ GDP they generate. The occupational dimension is demonstrated by the rise of service industries, and highlights that in information societies, the majority of employees are not involved in the production of tangible goods. The spatio-temporal dimension of the information society is centered around networks, digital technologies, and hyper-connectivity that transcend some of the time and space constraints of the physical world. Think, for example, of how information technologies allow you to engage with groups distributed around the globe or attend a live event taking place in Australia or Norway no matter where you are in the world. Think of how in the middle of the night, you can virtually be somewhere where it is the middle of the day. The cultural dimension of the information society points to the role of information in the production and reproduction of culture and individual and collective identities. Finally, the theoretical knowledge dimension emphasizes the rise of evidence-based practice and the centrality of data, information and knowledge as the increasingly dominant drivers of individual and collective action.\nThese dimensions are not independent from one another and are in fact all intertwined, so it can be difficult to consider one without the others. Still, they allow us to consider our world and the kind of problems we are dealing with from different angles, which can help us achieve a more holistic perspective on information and its role in society, and perhaps better solutions to the information problems that we will tackle as information professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nDespite being a little bit dated and not written for an information science audience, the following book (which used to be the foundation of the course) can be a useful resource if you are interested in getting an overview of the main theories of the information societies that have been proposed by scholars over the last 50 years or so.\nWebster, F.

    "section": "3.3 Types of information issues",
    "text": "3.3 Types of information issues\nIn the previous chapter and class, we explored the concept of information. We situated it in relation to dozens of other related concepts, which I hope helped you expand your understanding of how information manifests itself in the different spheres of society. No matter where we look in this complex conceptual landscape, we can find opportunities and challenges for information professionals, or let’s call them “information issues” for us to tackle. I would argue that are three fundamental forms of information issues:\n\nIssues of information access\nIssues of information quantity\nIssues of information quality\nIssues of information behaviour\n\nSome of these will come back in one way or another in the following chapters, so the goal is to provide a high-level overview and introduce some topics we will dive more deeply into later on.\n\n3.3.1 Access issues\nArticle 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”. Also, Article 27.1 is states that “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits”. These two points are closely tied to several of the core values of the field presented in chapter 1, such as stewardship and intellectual freedom. The term participate in Article 27.1 can be related to access in terms of having access to the means of production and dissemination of information (e.g., computer, smartphone, internet).\nDespite being considered a universal human right, there are still many ways in which access to information is limited in the world today. Some of the constraints can be physical when information is recorded on a non-digital medium and stored in a specific location, which may or may not be easily accessed, or when digital information resources are behind a paywall. Access to information is at the core of the mission of libraries that build collections of physical and digital information resources so the communities they serve can access them. This also applies to other settings in which information professionals work; there is often (if not always) an information user, with more or less explicit and clearly defined information needs, and an information professional whose role may be to ensure that the user has access to the information they need to fulfill those information needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nDo you think that all information should be accessible to everyone? If not, what kind of information do you think should not accessible to all? How can you reconcile the notion that some information should not be accessible to all with the idea of information as a human right?\n\n\nAnother critical issue to consider is the inequalities in access to information. Since information is crucial for personal, social and professional development and for people to thrive in the information society, differences in access to information based on socio-demographic factors can contribute to creating or reinforcing existing inequalities. That is one of the reasons why equity, diversity, and inclusion is such an important topic in our field and one that you will find in many of your courses.\nThe unequal access to information is often referred to as the digital divide, defined as “the gap between individuals, households, business and geographic areas at different socioeconomic levels with regard both to their opportunities to access information and communication technologies and to their use of the internet for a wide variety of activities” (OECD, 2001). You can check out the network readiness index (https://networkreadinessindex.org/) to see how countries are doing in terms of making digital infrastructure, connectivity and governance. Even within a single country, demographic factors can have a strong relationship with physical access to information and information technology. Income, age, gender, education and location are all predictors of whether or not people have access to the internet. And varying levels of information literacy may lead members of some social groups not to access information even when it is available (Sparks 2013).\nAccess is also closely linked to the literacy concepts family (information literacy, data literacy, digital literacy, etc.), which is core to the information professions, especially in public and academic librarianship. That is where language and the ability to read and write come in, as one cannot have access to information if it is in a language that they do not understand or if it is in a written format and they don’t know how to read. Similarly, people cannot participate in the information society if they don’t have the basic ability to communicate. Teaching people how to read and write and use information technologies is not typically understood as the role of information professionals. However, public libraries are often used as community centers where such training can occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nIn what ways do you think technologies help solve information access issues?\nIn what ways do you think technologies do not help, or even accentuate, information access issues?\nHow do you think information professionals can play a role in ensuring that technologies effectively increase access to information?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Quantity issues\nThere is a lot of information in the world, and a lot of new information is produced every day (that is, of course, if you subscribe to the notion of information as a thing. Otherwise, we could rephrase this and say that there is a lot of information happening every day). Anyways, the following two quotes can help us grasp just how much information we are talking about.\n\nThe amount of information being created every two days is equivalent to that created from the dawn of civilization until the year 2003 (Benselin and Ragsdell 2016).\n\n\n“A weekly edition of the New York Times contains more information than the average person was likely to come across in a lifetime in seventeenth-century England” (Bawden and Robinson 2009).\n\nLiving in a world of information abundance, it may be difficult to imagine that we could still find ourselves in situations of information scarcity. Isn’t finding the information we need as simple as picking up our smartphones and “googling” whatever we want to know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of a situation in which you found yourself not finding (or having a lot of difficulty finding) the information that you needed? How did you feel? How did you cope with the situation? What was the outcome?\n\n\nYou may think that the general abundance of information is a good thing. After all, isn’t information the basis of all (or most) knowledge and of better “informed” decisions? Can there be too much of a good thing as information?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of a situation in which you found yourself having too much information? What was the context? How did you feel? How did you cope with the situation? What was the outcome?\n\n\nThe idea that there is a point where more information is just too much information is often called information overload. This is by no means a new phenomenon, but as technological developments increase our capacity to produce, disseminate and store information, so does the amount of information that the average human is exposed to and needs (or believes they need) to process or manage. When the amount of information exceeds our capacity for processing and managing it, we are in a situation of information overload (Misra and Stokols 2012). Information overload can cause many negative outcomes, including psychological stress, exhaustion, negative affect, decreased productivity (Matthes et al. 2020), information addiction, distraction, and symptoms similar to attention deficit disorder (Bawden and Robinson 2009).\nThe following video is about how having too much choice leads to poorer decisions or less satisfaction about our decisions, which the speaker calls the “paradox of choice”. I think it also applies to information and that we have, in fact, a “paradox of information”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Quality issues\nAccess to information is great, and access to a lot of information is even better (with some caveats, as we discussed above). However, another fundamental concern with our information society is the quality of the information available to us. Again, if information is the basis of all (or most) knowledge and better “informed” decisions, what happens if the information we receive is inaccurate or simply false? We may use our filtering mechanisms or critical thinking skills and reject that information. In this case, we have wasted some time. But what if we fail to recognize the poor quality of the information we receive and use it as a basis to form an important decision or to shape our worldview?\nThe widespread presence and spread of misinformation (and related concepts such as disinformation and fake news) has been facilitated by the rise of the internet and other information technologies that make the production and dissemination of information accessible to all. Bran et al. (2021) used the term Information pollution or ‘infollution’ to describe the growing problem of the spread of unwanted messages in society in quantity large enough to cause significant affect human and social activities, and consider conspiracy theories, propaganda, memes and memetic warfare, and ideological manipulation as forms of infollution that can result in wasted time, physical and mental health issues and stress or addiction. No matter how one calls it or in what shape or form it presents itself, misinformation is one of the greatest challenges of our age.\nThere are other ways to think about information quality that come short of falling under the “misinformation” label. For example, we may consider that information is of poor quality when it is, for one reason or another, not effective in achieving the desired goal (e.g., to inform, to increase knowledge, to make a decision). It may also be useful to think about information not only in terms of a single information unit (e.g., a news article or a single statement in a text) but also in terms of collections of information units (e.g., a library collection, a set of resources used to support a decision).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of ways in which valid and accurate information may be ineffective at fulfilling an information need or supporting a decision or action?\n\n\nInformation issues can lead to Information anxiety, defined as the state “produced by the ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand. It is the black hole between data and knowledge, and it happens when information doesn’t tell us what we want or need to know” (Naveed 2020, 66). Its symptoms may include the inability to keep up with the information we are presented, frustration over the quality of information available, guilt about not being better informed, or the desire to be the first to know.\n\n\n3.3.4 Behaviour issues\nSo far, we have mainly discussed issues related to the information itself and its accessibility, quantity and quality. However, the last fundamental form of information relates not to the information itself and its characteristics but to how we use it or interact with it: our information behaviour.\nSuppose we side with Hjørland (2007) and consider that only the subjective/situational concept of information is helpful for information professionals. Then we must conclude that all information phenomena that information professionals care about involve humans (or computers) that seek, evaluate, filter, store, organize, produce, disseminate, share, use, or react to information in their own way depending on the context. In that case, the information world we live in (and all its issues of access, quantity, and quality) is the product of individual or group behaviour. However, our information behaviour has effects that transcend the informational world and can positively or negatively affect our individual and collective lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a positive impact on our lives or the lives of others?\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a negative impact on our lives or the lives of others?\n\n\nThe notion of intent is important to consider when thinking about information and the outcomes of our information behaviour. For example, a corporation may intentionally reduce access to information by creating a paywall around highly valuable information. We may produce and disseminate a lot (quantity) of free content (access) with catchy titles but a low informative value (quality) to attract readers and generate ad revenues (intent). A social media user may intentionally post information (true or false) about someone else in order to hurt them. We may intentionally or unintentionally produce or share misinformation. Finally, we may intend to fulfill an information need by gathering a lot of information resources, but we end up causing information overload, analysis paralysis, or anxiety for ourselves or our users or clients."

If not, what kind of information do you think should not accessible to all? How can you reconcile the notion that some information should not be accessible to all with the idea of information as a human right?\n\n\nDespite the fact that access to information is a universal human right and plays an essential role in the achievement of personal, social, occupational and educational goals, there are a lot of ways in which our access to information is limited.\nThere is an important technological dimension to issues of information access. We can think\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nIn what ways are information technology\n\n\nThe digital divide has been defined as “the gap between individuals, households, business and geographic areas at different socioeconomic levels with regard both to their opportunities to access information and communication technologies and to their use of the internet for a wide variety of activities” (OECD, 2001). The digital divide has existed for a long time and is not going away any time soon. It has been shown through the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) that the digital divide is especially relevant between advanced economies and the rest of the world. This divide is important because it shows that not everyone has the same access to information.\nSkills and access to ICT are required for a lot of different jobs and have become integral to social life. People who do not have access may be socially excluded (Sparks, 2013).\nDemographic factors tend to have a strong influence on technology skills, physical access and how people use these technologies. Income, age, gender, education and location are all predictors of whether or not people have access to internet. Developed countries also have more access as internet connectivity is connected to per capita gross domestic product. There are large differences in the way people use digital technologies, and some social groups choose not to access the information on the internet even when it is available to them (Sparks, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nIn what ways do you think technologies help solve information access issue?\nIn what ways do you think technologies do not help, or even accentuate information access issues?\nHow do you think information professional\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Issue of information quantity\n“the amount of information being created every two days is equivalent to that created from the dawn of civilization until year 2003” (Benselin & Ragsdell, 2016, pg. 285). “A weekly edition of the New York Times contains more information than the average person was likely to come across in a lifetime in seventeenth-century England” (Bawden & Robinson, 2009, p. 184).\nHaving a lot of information available may not immediately appear to be a bad thing. After all, isn’t information the basis of all (or most) knowledge and of better “informed” decisions?\nWhile the main focus of the following TED talk is choices and not information, I would argue that the phenomenon discussed, which the author calls the “paradox of choice” can be applied to information and that what we experience in modern society may be a form of “paradox of information”, where information overload can lead to “analysis paralysis” and a decrease in decision quality (Jacoby 1977).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The idea that there is a point where more information is just too much information is often called information overload. This is by no means a new phenomenon, but has technological development increase our capacity to produce, disseminate and store information, so does the amount of information that the average human is exposed to and needs (or believes they need) to process or manage. When the amount of information exceeds our capacity for processing and managing it, we are in a situation of information overload (Misra & Stokols 2012).\nInformation overload can cause many negative outcomes including psychological stress, exhaustion, negative affect and decreased productivity (Matthes, 2020). Psychological conditions can also result from IO including continuous partial attention; stress caused by needing to be connected at all times and attention deficit trait in which people are distracted and impatient (Bawden & Robinson, 2009).\n\n\n3.4.2 Information quality\nInformation disorders exist and can take on three different forms; misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. Misinformation is defined as “false information that is not intended to cause any harm” (Bran et al., 2021, p. 2). Disinformation is defined as “false information that is intentionally spread in order to cause harm” (Bran et al., 2021, p. 2). Lastly, malinformation is defined as “true information that is manipulated to cause harm” (Bran et al., 2021, p. 2). Information disorders come in many different forms ranging from satire or parody, to fabricated or misleading content, or false context.\nInformation pollution or ‘infollution’ is a growing problem and is defined as “the presence and spread of unwanted messages in human society, in large enough quantities to cause significant negative effects on human and social activities” (Bran et al., 2021, p. 1). Information pollution can take on many different forms including conspiracy theories, propaganda, memes and memetic warfare, and ideological manipulation and can result in wasted time, physical and mental health issues and stress or addiction.\n\n\n3.4.3 Information anxiety\nInformation anxiety has been defined as the state “produced by the ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand. It is the black hole between data and knowledge, and it happens when information doesn’t tell us what we want or need to know” (Naveed, 2020 pg. 66). With the increase in information and communication channels, information has increased in its volume and breadth, creating more information anxiety. There are two main factors that contribute to information anxiety- poor literacy skills and the increased quantity of information. Shedroff (2001) described information anxiety as having many different causes including information overload, lack of understanding, inability to navigate the information landscape, and poorly organized information.\nInformation has been described as having many different forms\n\nThe inability to keep up with the information we are presented\nFrustration over the quality of information available\nGuilt about not being better informed\nThe desire to know things first\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Information literacy\n\n\n3.4.5 Privacy\nInformation as a weapon\nIssues of equity, diversity and inclusion\nIssues of information organization"

These characters will deal with many scenarios in which information affects their day to day lives, giving you a chance to offer the classmates advice, and consider how you might deal with similar situations.\n\n3.5.1 The characters\nWren Reilly (she/her) is a 28-year-old from Collingwood, a small town in Ontario. Wren is an aspiring data manager hoping to work in a position that allows her to work independently and utilize her organizational skills. Wren hopes that her undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Toronto will lend itself well to her future career in data management. She is a logical, individualistic, and introverted individual who works well under pressure. Wren worked for a couple of small new businesses throughout her 20s, helping with programming, and worked in tech support for a larger organization. She plans to work with an organization one day where she can use the knowledge she will gain of databases to deal with big data.\nDante de Luca (he/they) is a 24-year-old from Calgary, Alberta and aspiring public librarian. Dante has an undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Calgary. They considered a career in social work before realizing that public librarianship would allow them to combine their love of helping others with their desire to engage with the community. Dante has always had a passion for libraries. They grew up going to their local library every Saturday with their mom. Throughout high school they volunteered as a reading buddy for younger children and volunteered with newcomers through the English language learning programs at the Calgary Central Library during their undergraduate degree. In the years before deciding to return to school to pursue a graduate degree Dante worked as a front desk administrator at a dog sled tour company in Canmore Alberta. Dante is an extroverted and caring individual who has leadership qualities and aims to one day be the chief executive librarian of a system of libraries.\nJude Jamieson (he/him) is a 31-year-old originally from Cape Breton Nova Scotia. Jude has an undergraduate degree in History from Acadia University. He spent his twenties trying to decide what direction he wants his career to go. He has worn many hats including baker, server and research assistant. Ultimately, he decided that he wanted to pursue further education to work as an archivist. He feels that his love of history and research will suit this profession well. Jude has utilized the archives in the past, working with the archivist at Acadia when he was writing his undergraduate thesis. He loves the idea of organizing and working with the artifacts that make up our past. Jude is an introverted, thoughtful and nostalgic individual and would love to work as a digital archivist.\nTracy Mina Brown (she/they) is a 40-year-old who grew up in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Tracy received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Amsterdam. Before deciding to apply for the MI program Tracy worked as a professional in a non-profit organization, as well as a digital content manager. Her job requires this sort of confident, extroverted, team-player visage, which she does well, but then she needs and really enjoys the quiet and focus of just doing the work alone. She enjoys being highly focused and sees this as a strength. Tracy is pursuing a career in knowledge management, preferably with a non-profit in the arts.\n\n\n3.5.2 Setting\nYou, Wren, Dante, Jude and Tracy have all just started your first year as Master of Information Students at Dalhousie University. You met during the orientation process put on by the university. While sitting on the patio at a pub down by the waterfront you discuss what led each of you to the information profession or back to school.\nYou all sit down and order your food and drinks. You are curious and ask the others: What brought you to the MI program?\nJude: Well, my undergraduate degree was in history and focused on a Nova Scotian context. When I finished my degree I worked as a baker for a few years, but I kept picking up side-projects with the local archives in my town; transcribing documents online, digitizing my family’s cookbooks. After a while, I figured that if this was something I was interested in, I should pursue it as a career!\nDante: That’s so cool how you were able to take your interests and turn them into career passions! For me, I’ve always loved to read, and I’ve dreamed of opening a bookstore and coffee shop for years. I ended up going to school for psychology and business but realized along the way that opening a business wasn’t for me. I talked to a family friend who works as a librarian, and it seemed like the perfect fit honestly. I would still get to work with books and people but without the stress of keeping a business afloat. I just want to make the world a better place and I think libraries can really help make that possible. Creating a space where people of all backgrounds can gather, and where information and knowledge are free is so important! I know that to become a librarian I’ll need the ALA accreditation so that affected my decision to apply to Dalhousie.\nJude: I also thought the ALA accreditation would be great to have as an archivist. Looking over the competencies that are developed through this degree, it seemed that they would all be directly relevant to the skills I would need to be successful in my career.\nWren: I’m really interested in the technology part of the program and my goal is to land a data science position in a tech firm, and then move up to a management role. I have a background in computer science and what attracted me to the program is that it brings together technology, management, information, and people in a way that will be more beneficial for me than the computer science programs which are very focused on technology.\nTracy: I came here after a career in non-profits. I have a fine arts degree and if you’re not a gallery or corporate artist, then you work in non-profits. But I wasn’t really trained formally for dealing with an organization’s challenges. I mean, I can creatively problem solve, which they seem to appreciate, but honestly, just as much fails as often as it works, and I don’t even know why. So, while I really like the non-profit I was with and I think their cause is amazing, I came back to school because I felt like every day I was just winging it. It would be nice to know how things should and can work, rather than hoping they work!\nWren: That’s a good reason to apply to school, Tracy! Say, did our order get put through? I guess they forgot, it’s been like 45 minutes!\nDante: Ya, but look how busy it is here. The servers are run off their feet, I bet their communication is not ideal with this much going on.\nLooking around, they recognize the importance of information flows in this restaurant and in all kinds of businesses. They realize that they have all experienced related issues in their previous careers.\nDante: I totally understand what it’s like to have issues with informational flow. When I worked at a dog sled tour company there was always issues with the communication between the front desk staff and the customers. There was a tight cancellation policy and if it wasn’t understood properly customers would end up paying for tours they couldn’t attend, and boy, did that make them angry! No one wants to feel like they’ve wasted $400!\nWren: Jeez, I bet that caused a lot of headaches for the front desk! What did you think could have been done better to avoid those issues?\nDante: I think if we had had a database and computer system that would keeps track of our client and bookings and sent out automated confirmation emails there would be a lot less room for human error and a better flow of communication! I found that the owners weren’t too open to my suggestions though so I made a point of returning to school so that I could bring my ideas to a new organization!\nJude: Yeah, that’s a really good reason to quit! I used to work as a baker and would often deal with supply chain issues. It wasn’t always communicated to us properly what was and wasn’t available, so it was hard to plan our menu. Customers weren’t always happy when we couldn’t have their favorite baked good available, but we tried our best!\nTracy: People can be really grumpy in the morning before their morning cup and bagel, that’s for sure! When I worked at the non-profit, we spent a lot of time applying for grants and often found that the instructions for what was expected were not clear. This made it so hard to gain the funding we required. Every time I wrote one for our organization, I felt like I was just making this stuff up, as I never really knew what people were working on in our organization, or what projects they wanted to get done. Also, we were all over the place with people in countries around the globe – it was impossible to meet them all let alone know what their ambitions were.\nWren: Wow, I never really thought about all the ways that lack of communication or misunderstandings can really affect how so many businesses are run. I worked on several coding projects during my undergrad, and we had different people working on the same code and sometimes that would be a mess when we didn’t have a shared understanding of the project’s goal, or when people didn’t document their changes properly. That can get very inefficient, and frustrating!\nYou have been sitting back and listening to the conversation between your new classmates. Consider the following questions relating the conversation.\n\n\n3.5.3 Discussion Questions\n\nWhat are 1-2 benefits you think Jude will get out of the MI program?\nWhat 1-2 benefits you think Tracy will get out of the MI program?\nConsider the benefits you provided for each Jude and Tracy. Where they exactly the same? If not, how would you explain the differences?\nLook at the SIM course offerings to propose a set of elective MI courses for Dante – explain your choices.\nWhat are 1 or 2 information problems you have experienced in your life up to now? How did you handle these issues?"

However, the last fundamental form of information relates not to the information itself and its characteristics but to how we use it or interact with it: our information behaviour.\nSuppose we side with Hjørland (2007) and consider that only the subjective/situational concept of information is useful for information professionals, then we must conclude that all information phenomena that information professionals care about involve humans (or a computers) that seek, evaluate, filter, store, organize, produce, disseminate, share, use, or react to information in their own way depending on the context. Then, the information world that we live in (and all its issues of access, quantity, and quality) is the product of individual or group behaviour. However, our information behaviour has effects that transcend the informational world and that can positively or negatively affect our individual and collective lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a positive impact on our lives or the lives of others?\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a negative impact on our lives or the lives of others?\n\n\nThe notion of intent is important to consider when thinking about information the outcomes of our information behaviour. A corporation may intentionally reduce access to information by creating a paywall around highly valuable information. We may produce and disseminate a lot (quantity) of free content (access) with catchy titles but low informative value (quality) in order to attract readers and generate ad revenues (intent). A social media user may intentionally post information (true or false) about someone else in order to hurt them. We may intentionally or unintentionally produce or share misinformation. We may intend to fulfill an information need by gathering a lot of information resources, but end up causing information overload, analysis paralysis, or anxiety for ourselves or our users or clients."

So, who are we?\nPeople have different personalities in different in person situations, so too do people present themselves differently on social media. Technologies, and social media more particularly, provide access to different audiences and different aspects of one’s own personality. When we tweet, or post on Facebook or Instagram, we are communicating with multiple audiences, for which our posts may carry different meanings. Zizi Papacharissi (2012) studied the ways in which people present themselves publicly on Twitter (what she calls networked performances). In her paper, she discusses how social media platforms are a space where people interact with others and fulfill their need for expression and social integration. By engaging with others and by posting information about themselves, users perform one or multiple versions of themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nHow do you think the information technologies that you do or don’t use shape your identity?\nIs there such a thing as an authentic self?"

Through such technologies as television and virtual reality people feel as though they are familiar with locations they may never see in real life.\nTechnologies such as automobiles and planes have changed the way that we travers physical spaces. People are able to travel distances that in the past would have taken days, weeks or years. You can tell that space has been manipulated in the way that humans talk about trips in terms of minutes instead of distance.\nPeople have been conditioned to expect immediacy. They want to have access to food at any time of the day, to shop even when stores are closed and have their mobile phones with them at all times, always being contactable. These changes have also resulted in what has been called 'proximity politics'. When people are bombarded with news about a place, they have never been to they may begin to feel as though they are experts on the region.\nPeople have a compulsion to proximity; they have an impulse to meet up with people face to face regardless of their virtual relationships. Webster believes that virtual communications and relationships will not replace interpersonal connections. Webster wrote this text in 2014, do you believe that the onset of Covid-19 changed these ideas? Or do you think that people's desires to 'return to normal' align more closely with this idea of compulsion to proximity? (Webster, 2014).\n\n4.5.1 Networked Individualization\nNetworked individualization refers to the fact that people can use technologies to stay in contact with the people in their life, enabling communities to form out of \"networks of interpersonal ties that provide sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging and social identity to the individual\" (Webster 7, pg. 143).\nTo help think about this, we can think of three ways in which humans are connected to one another. Door-to-door connectivity occurs when people live, work and play in one place. Their connections are with their immediate neighbors. Place-to-place connectivity is when people are connected through travelling and gathering together in a network of places. Person-to-person connectivity is placeless and consists of relationships mediated through information technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nThink of different communities or social networks that you belong to.\n\n\n\nNetworked individualization is not just about people connecting to people.

The informatic person lives within the informatic context which is the technological, economic and social networks. The informatic person experiences and influences the informatic context through data interfaces, data circulation, and data abstraction.\nData interfaces “are those systems, devices, infrastructures and objects that connect (individuals or collectives) to broader assemblages of data” (Lee 2021, 173). Your smartphone, smart watch, tablet, television, computer, and the specific sites or apps that you use (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, TikTok) are all data interfaces through which us humans experience the world. Data interfaces are also extractive as they are used by other entities on the network to extract data from you or about you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nThe examples above are all digital platforms or technologies. But not all data that exists is in a digital form. Can you think of other kinds of data interface that are not digital?\n\n\nData circulation refers to the dynamics of data mobility (and immobility); how data is created, moved, stored, shared and repurposed. Humans (but also other entities like machines, companies, and governments) all circulate data, and in fact, almost everything we do can be understood as a form of data circulation.\nData abstraction describes the many ways that data manipulation techniques are used by machines or humans and produce some sort of outcome (intended or not) (Lee 2021). It is essentially the raison d'être of data interfaces and data circulation. Here's an example: through our smartphone (interface) Google Maps collects data about the current traffic conditions (data circulation) and updates directions to make routes quicker and more efficient.\nLiving in the informatic context are informatic persons who navigate their existence through and with data (Lee 2021). Our informatic personhood is not separated from our physical, biological selves. People develop physical injuries from texting on their smartphone, typing on keyboards, or looking at screens. The informatic context also changes our brains, as humans develop neuro-physical mechanisms to handle things such as information overload and the data interfaces that constantly seek your attention. The informatic context can actually change our attention spans and ability to concentrate (Lee 2021)."

    "text": "4.3 Networks, standards and marginality\nNetworks are all around us (e.g., phones, computers, road systems, the post) and many of these networks become stabilized and standardized over time. We can think of these networks as the informatic contexts within which we live our informatic personhood. We access the networks through data interfaces and then circulate data on the networks which generate some outcomes. This section is about the standardizing forces of networks that constrain the ways in which we can access them and the things we can do on them. Indeed, every network is characterized by a more or less stable set of norms and standards, some of which can be extremely difficult to change once the network is stabilized. For example, choosing the color red for stoplights was an arbitrary choice initially but has become so universal that it is no longer a choice.\nNetworks are also not neutral. They are populated with actors or groups that have more influence or power than others and are thus able to influence the structure of the networks, how they operate, and what their norms and standards come to be. Those who happen to fit the standards are able to navigate the network with some ease, but others those who do not fit the standards can find themselves marginalized and excluded. Since there is always a gap between the standards of social or technological networks and the needs of the individuals that live inside (or outside) of them, we can think of the marginalization of actors on the network s a continuum: everyone is marginalized to some degree. Susan Leigh Star (1990) discusses the problem of standardization through an analogy. They are allergic to onions, and observed that their order for a burger with no onions at McDonalds would take a very long time to be prepared. They realized that because the standard process of preparing a burger at McDonalds includes onions, going against this standard \"breaks the system\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggesting reading\n\n\n\nThis short post about life without a smartphone illustrates some of the points Star (1990) made long before smartphones even existed:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/04/my-life-without-a-smartphone-is-getting-harder-and-harder"

    "text": "4.6 Case study\nDante and Wren meet you, Tracy, and Jude at a local coffee shop one summer afternoon just before you begin your second year in the Master of Information program. Tracy and Jude spent the summer working in the city while Dante and Wren have just returned from a month of travelling. They went on a road trip around Nova Scotia exploring seaside towns and enjoying many beach days. You have been keeping up with their frequent social media updates on their accounts: 'Throw_a_Wren-ch_in_it\" and \"All_you've_ever_Dante-d\" where they post updates and pictures of their adventures. You notice that Jude and Tracy's online activity and social media content differs from Wren and Dante's. You consider your own information networks and how you exist as an informatic person.\n\nYou: Good to see you Dante, Wren! Wow, you both look like summer has treated you well!\nWren: Hey strangers! You just wouldn't believe this past month- pure bliss. Once I graduate, I'm living on the beach full time, just try and stop me!\nDante: Says the person who complained about the Atlantic Ocean being too cold the entire month of August.\nWren: At least I'm not so afraid of sharks I won't even go in the water past my ankles. Say, do you follow that great white shark tracker online? Everyone is tweeting about their geographic locations around Nova Scotia beaches and panicking. I feel like they get a bad rap.\nTracy: Oh yes, I do follow that! I feel like it's a nice way to see a global network of such an amazing creature. I think widespread panic regarding something like sharks is unavoidable in a large online setting like Twitter… besides, don't you think social media and being online distorts the way we view anything?\n\nDante: What do you mean?\nTracy: Well, I guess we can all be interpreted differently online depending on how we exist and interact in our networks. Take your accounts, for example. You and Wren aren't a part of the beach brigade all year round, you know? All Wren has been posting about lately is lobster rolls and lifeguards she finds dreamy. If you didn't personally know her, would you be surprised to learn she is working towards a career in data management?!\nWren: But… that is me! I'm behind the screen posting those things! Are you saying I'm not as adventurous and fun in person as I look online? Also, data is fun!\nTracy: I think you are even more so, friend! But we all curate ourselves and engage differently online, right? Like, I don't share pics of my kid, for example. That's just too personal for me.\n\nJude: I agree with Tracy. I have a co-worker who posts his original poetry on his social media. It comes across totally innocent; at work he is such a nice guy! We found out the other day that he has been writing about the new interns and sending his poems to them on their personal social media accounts! Let's just say he's getting reviewed this week…\n\nDante: Well, I wrote and posted many a song on my guitar as Wren and I gallivanted across our glorious province this summer, and all of them were simply odes to my love of Mother Nature. No harm in that!\n\nWren: Not all true! Remember when you wrote that cheesy song for your boyfriend's birthday and accidentally posted it on your public social media?!\nDante: Oh, right! Only my mom ended up watching it before I took it down, but I wouldn't really mind if others had listened to it. I express myself more freely online.\nJude: I've got to hear this song! I do too, Dante. I feel more comfortable sharing my views on various social justice issues on my blog than I do talking about my opinions in class. I feel more confident online, almost like I can be a different person behind the screen. I also just feel like I have more tools and information at my disposal to connect my thoughts and make more informed arguments!\nWren: You are so tactful and thoughtful about your online activism though, Jude. Unlike that one politician who blasts people on Twitter all the time. That has really been detrimental to his professional life.\nDante: Yeah, like that dude I know who got fired because of the insensitive things he was posting on his Facebook.\nTracy: That's exactly what I'm afraid of! I've had some platforms for so long that at this point I have a huge mix of professional colleagues, friends, and family involved in my networks, so I have to engage very thoughtfully online. I do enjoy connecting my various worlds and communities and wish I felt freer to share different types of content, but my content seems to be increasingly restrained. I'm down to recipes now, for the most part.\nWren: Well, I still stand by the fact that Wren in real life is the same person who has reviewed 30 different versions of lobster rolls, with a side of lifeguards. I think that's rather impressive data collection, considering I was on vacation…\nYou realize you have been scrolling through your phone for the past 10 minutes, considering how you engage online. You are connected with Dante, Wren, Jude, and Tracy on social media and other online networks (e.g. online learning software, social platforms, professional development sites, digital correspondence).\nYou continue contemplating the topics that have come up in your conversation. Consider how you exist in your information networks, in a mobile society, and your own informatic personhood.\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nIn what ways might Wren's online persona be authentic? In what ways might it be curated?  \nHow do you feel about workplaces punishing people for the content on their personal social media channels?\nDo you think it's ok for companies to look at personal social media accounts in the hiring process?\nDo you believe companies have the right to monitor the activities of their employees in a personal setting? Would you consider social media and online platforms a private or public environment?\nWhat are 3-4 different online communities you are a part of (school, family, friends, work, etc.)? Consider how you establish and situate yourself in your networks.\nWhat information do you share online? Does this change based on the online space you are in?\nConsider 1-2 ways in which technology facilitates or inhibits your ability to interact in your in-person and online networks. How do you act as a bridge between various worlds?\nConsider the differences (or similarities) in how you interact with friends, professional colleagues, or other groups online versus in person. In what ways do you engage with them differently online than you do face to face? Do you feel you take on a different persona? What benefits or detriments do you perceive as a result of this difference?\n\n\n\n\n\nLee, Ashlin. 2021. “Towards Informatic Personhood: Understanding Contemporary Subjects in a Data-Driven Society.” Information, Communication & Society 24 (2): 167–82. https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1637446.\n\n\nPapacharissi, Zizi. 2012. “Without You, I’m Nothing: Performances of the Self on Twitter.” International Journal of Communication 6 (0): 18. https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1484.\n\n\nStar, Susan Leigh. 1990. “Power, Technology and the Phenomenology of Conventions: On Being Allergic to Onions.” The Sociological Review 38 (1_suppl): 26–56. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1990.tb03347.x.\n\n\nWebster, Frank. 2014. “Network Society: Manuel Castells.” In Theories of the Information Society, Fourth edition, 106–36.
