As we will see in this chapter, information management degrees are about a lot more than librarianship and can provide you with many opportunities.

ALA-accredited degrees are generally a requirement for a range of positions in libraries of all kinds and other related organizations. Accordingly, most students reading this chapter are likely to be interested in pursuing a career in librarianship. Many of you, however, are in this program with completely different careers in mind, and you may be surprised by the emphasis on libraries. Perhaps some of you just have no prior thoughts about the program or the field as you are taking this course as an elective, or simply because you ended up here randomly. Whatever group you might find yourself in, now that you are here you might be surprised by the breadth of the discipline and the many professional pathways that it can lead you down. Who knows, maybe you joined the program to be a children services librarian, and will come out of it an aspiring data scientist? So, what are the information professions? Marcia Bates (2015) referred to our discipline as a meta-discipline that spans across the entire spectrum of traditional research disciplines, from the Arts and Humanities to the Natural Science. While it is by no means comprehensive, this figure from Bates (2015) was an attempt to illustrate the breath of the discipline by situating many of the sub-disciplines across that spectrum.\nThe diversity of the information profession can also be observed through the many job titles that the MLIS jobs report shows.\nThis degree does not just lead to librarianship or working as an archivist, in fact there are many different job titles that an MI can lead to.

    "text": "1.3 Skills to succeed as an information professional\nAlthough we will narrow in on a few different career options in the following sections, there are some core skills that have been mentioned as valuable regardless of the direction you choose. San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management. You can learn more about the different roles, job duties you may encounter and the skills you will need to be successful. There is also more information on the professional values of each sector and the professional associations that you may be able to join."

    "section": "1.4 Public Librarianship",
    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

These include but are not limited to access and reference services librarian, outreach and diversity librarian, materials and image librarian, and staff engagement liaison. Although there are so many different titles within academic librarianship there are some job duties that appear often. These include reference assistance, assisting faculty in research and teaching research, delivering courses on research, creating LibGuides, helping to select which journals to purchase, analyzing usage statistics and outreach and marketing (MLIS Skills at Work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.2 Skills\nThere are some skills that you should be working on if you are looking to work within an academic library. These include knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet and data applications, knowledge of the open access movement and the scholarly publishing industry, multitasking, interpersonal skills, customer service and knowledge of copyright practices (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.3 Professional values\nWhen it comes to professional values, academic librarianship has very similar values to public librarianship such as access, diversity, preservation, education and privacy (Core values of librarianship, 2019).\n\n\n1.5.4 Professional Associations\nLibrary associations are formed so that librarians with similar interests can come together to share ideas. Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\n1.5.5 Special Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\n1.5.6 Jobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.7 Skills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

You may end up as a medical content reference librarian, a medical research librarian, or a health sciences librarian. Some job duties you may encounter in health librarianship include creating search acquisition strategies, keyword searches, managing SEO campaigns, packaging research data into insightful deliverables and planning, promoting and administering library services and resources (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.2 Skills\nSome skills that are important for those working in this field include research and analysis skills, project management skills, the ability to prioritize and multitask, excellent oral and written skills, and being proficient at searching online databases (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.3 Professional Values\nThe Special Library Association states on their website that the core professional values of special librarianship are leadership, service, results and accountability, collaboration and partnering and innovation and continuous learning (Abram, 2019).\n\n\n1.6.4 Professional Associations\nThere are also professional associations related to special libraries. For example, there is the Special Libraries Association. There are also associations dedicated specifically to health librarianship including the Canadian Health Libraries Association and the Medical Library Association. And associations for law librarianship including the American Association of Law Libraries and the Canadian Association of Law Libraries.\n\n\n1.6.5 Data Management\n\n\n1.6.6 Jobs\nThere are so many different jobs in the data management field. Some sample job titles include Data analytics manager, data librarian, data visualization and GIS specialist, and manager of data governance. Some duties you may encounter within these roles include leading a university library’s research data services initiative, partnering with researchers to advance the knowledge and management of data, or answering questions on data management for faculty and staff at a university (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.7 Skills\nSome of the skills that you may need to work in data management include experience working with complicated datasets, knowledge of data software such as tableau, and an understanding of information management practices such as carrying out data needs assessments (MLIS skills at work, 2022). If you have a passion for data, consider tailoring your courses to working with data. Courses such as data science and data management will help you to learn the skills you need to succeed. Digital librarianship Jobs With the world shifting towards more online content, digitization is becoming more and more important making digital librarianship is a worthwhile field of librarianship to pursue. Digital librarianship can have many different job titles including digital collections manager, electronic resources librarian, virtual resources librarian or digital and automated services librarian. When working in digital librarianship you may find yourself supervising activities related to the digitization of collections, providing consultation and technical support for the development of technology reliant research projects or engaging in the assessment, maintenance and enhancement of digital collections and services (MLIS skills at work, 2022). Skills If you are interested in digital librarianship, it could be helpful to take extra advanced technology courses during your degree. This will help you to gain the skills you need for the field such as ability to learn new technologies quickly, experience with metadata, knowledge of digitization standards and an interest in electronic information sources and organizations (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nStephanie Bilodeau\nManager, Open Government and Data Governance\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police – IM/IT Program\nStephanie wears two hats with her job at the RCMP, she is the manager of Open Government and the manager of Data Governance. There is a big need for these positions because programmers created systems to store data but more needs to be done to organize and manage that data. They have found that when using these systems things aren’t accurate, queries are not always pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech focused so it’s important to know how information is managed through IT systems. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.\nThe Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired to a government position. They offer full time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also have the ability to bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html\nThe best advice Stephanie would give is to be open minded and willing to learn constantly. Always try new things and make sure that the work you are doing is aligned with your organizations’ mission and corporate vision."

Some of the roles that fall under knowledge management include knowledge synthesizer, knowledge analyst, knowledge navigator and of course knowledge manager. Some of the main duties you may encounter within this field are handling a company’s knowledge management operations, formulating a knowledge management strategy, managing knowledge management staff and influencing change within an organization. Tasks you may be asked to perform include curating technical website content, designing and implementing effective learning activities and managing knowledge sharing events (Postolache, 2019). Skills If you are looking to become a knowledge manager it is possible to obtain a knowledge management certificate on top of your degree to increase your chances of employment (Postolache, 2019).\n\n\n1.7.2 Professional Values\n????????????????????\n\n\n1.7.3 Professional Associations\n????????????????????\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nTrecia enrolled in the MLIS program at McGill University and specialized in knowledge management to learn how to best share knowledge. During her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their business information center, and she learned that efficient knowledge sharing strategies rely on a good understanding of your audience. Knowledge management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and you must constantly re-evaluate to make sure that the collected resources are useful for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now a community services librarian managing the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the Books-by-Mail service. Her job involves public relations and communications, outreach, and programming. One of her main focuses is community led programming, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that best fits their communities’ needs. She finds that programming works best when there is a commitment from the community to participate. Community led programming begins with conversations with patrons to try to determine what programs they would like to see. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, a lot of important skills are required of a successful community services librarian. Communication is important, especially formal communication, everything from social media etiquette to doing media press releases. You need to be able to speak with media outlets as a representative of the library at public tables. Management and leadership skills are also necessary along with time management, project management and knowledge management. Public speaking skills are necessary as you would be giving presentations and teaching staff, as well as running public workshops and programs. Experience with research and report writing is also an asset.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information, the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.9 Archives\n\n1.9.1 Jobs\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian. Some job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public (MLIS skills at work, 2022)\n\n\n1.9.2 Skills\nSome skills you may need to work in these positions include an ability to work independently as well as in a group, knowledge of intellectual property issues, and knowledge of standards of archival description and bibliographic control (MLIS Skills at work, 2022). Dalhousie offers courses in archives that will provide you with the skills you need to be successful in your career such as Archives 1 and 2. You are also able to complete a work practicum or internship within an archive to gain direct experience.\n\n\n1.9.3 Professional values\nSome of the core values of archivists include access and use, accountability, advocacy, diversity, history and memory, preservation, responsible stewardship, selection, service, social responsibility, and sustainability. If you want to learn more about these core values which were published the Society of American Archivists, take a look at their website (Society of American Archivists, 2020).\n\n\n1.9.4 Professional associations\nIf you are looking to join any professional associations for archivists there is the Association of Canadian Archivists, along with the Canadian Council of Archives. Each province also has its own council or association. Nova Scotia has the Council of Nova Scotia Archives. Click on the links to learn more about each association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor Council of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access. Sharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current. Sharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented. The best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

ALA-accredited degrees are generally a requirement for a range of positions in libraries of all kinds and other related organizations. Accordingly, most students reading this chapter are likely to be interested in pursuing a career in librarianship. Many of you, however, are in this program with completely different careers in mind, and you may be surprised by the emphasis on libraries. Perhaps some of you just have no prior thoughts about the program or the field as you are taking this course as an elective, or simply because you ended up here randomly. Whatever group you might find yourself in, now that you are here you might be surprised by the breadth of the discipline and the many professional pathways that it can lead you down. Who knows, maybe you joined the program to be a children services librarian, and will come out of it an aspiring data scientist? So, what are the information professions? Marcia Bates (2015) referred to our discipline as a meta-discipline that spans across the entire spectrum of traditional research disciplines, from the Arts and Humanities to the Natural Science. While it is by no means comprehensive, this figure from Bates (2015) was an attempt to illustrate the breath of the discipline by situating many of the sub-disciplines across that spectrum.\nThe diversity of the information profession can also be observed through the many job titles that the MLIS jobs report shows.\nThis degree does not just lead to librarianship or working as an archivist, in fact there are many different job titles that an MI can lead to. The following is a diverse list of job titles that you may find when looking for work in the MI field. Why don’t you take a look through these titles and see if any of them interest you, and then do a little bit of research to learn more?"

    "text": "1.3 Skills to succeed as an information professional\nAlthough we will narrow in on a few different career options in the following sections, there are some core skills that have been mentioned as valuable regardless of the direction you choose. San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management. You can learn more about the different roles, job duties you may encounter and the skills you will need to be successful. There is also more information on the professional values of each sector and the professional associations that you may be able to join."

    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

These include but are not limited to access and reference services librarian, outreach and diversity librarian, materials and image librarian, and staff engagement liaison. Although there are so many different titles within academic librarianship there are some job duties that appear often. These include reference assistance, assisting faculty in research and teaching research, delivering courses on research, creating LibGuides, helping to select which journals to purchase, analyzing usage statistics and outreach and marketing (MLIS Skills at Work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.2 Skills\nThere are some skills that you should be working on if you are looking to work within an academic library. These include knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet and data applications, knowledge of the open access movement and the scholarly publishing industry, multitasking, interpersonal skills, customer service and knowledge of copyright practices (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.3 Professional values\nWhen it comes to professional values, academic librarianship has very similar values to public librarianship such as access, diversity, preservation, education and privacy (Core values of librarianship, 2019).\n\n\n1.5.4 Professional Associations\nLibrary associations are formed so that librarians with similar interests can come together to share ideas. Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\n1.5.5 Special Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\n1.5.6 Jobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.5.7 Skills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

For example, there is the Special Libraries Association. There are also associations dedicated specifically to health librarianship including the Canadian Health Libraries Association and the Medical Library Association. And associations for law librarianship including the American Association of Law Libraries and the Canadian Association of Law Libraries.\n\n\n1.6.5 Data Management\n\n\n1.6.6 Jobs\nThere are so many different jobs in the data management field. Some sample job titles include Data analytics manager, data librarian, data visualization and GIS specialist, and manager of data governance. Some duties you may encounter within these roles include leading a university library’s research data services initiative, partnering with researchers to advance the knowledge and management of data, or answering questions on data management for faculty and staff at a university (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n1.6.7 Skills\nSome of the skills that you may need to work in data management include experience working with complicated datasets, knowledge of data software such as tableau, and an understanding of information management practices such as carrying out data needs assessments (MLIS skills at work, 2022).

Digital librarianship Jobs With the world shifting towards more online content, digitization is becoming more and more important making digital librarianship is a worthwhile field of librarianship to pursue. Digital librarianship can have many different job titles including digital collections manager, electronic resources librarian, virtual resources librarian or digital and automated services librarian. When working in digital librarianship you may find yourself supervising activities related to the digitization of collections, providing consultation and technical support for the development of technology reliant research projects or engaging in the assessment, maintenance and enhancement of digital collections and services (MLIS skills at work, 2022). Skills If you are interested in digital librarianship, it could be helpful to take extra advanced technology courses during your degree. This will help you to gain the skills you need for the field such as ability to learn new technologies quickly, experience with metadata, knowledge of digitization standards and an interest in electronic information sources and organizations (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nStephanie Bilodeau\nManager, Open Government and Data Governance\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police – IM/IT Program\nStephanie wears two hats with her job at the RCMP, she is the manager of Open Government and the manager of Data Governance. There is a big need for these positions because programmers created systems to store data but more needs to be done to organize and manage that data. They have found that when using these systems things aren’t accurate, queries are not always pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech focused so it’s important to know how information is managed through IT systems. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.\nThe Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired to a government position. They offer full time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also have the ability to bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html\nThe best advice Stephanie would give is to be open minded and willing to learn constantly. Always try new things and make sure that the work you are doing is aligned with your organizations’ mission and corporate vision."

Skills If you are looking to become a knowledge manager it is possible to obtain a knowledge management certificate on top of your degree to increase your chances of employment (Postolache, 2019).\n\n\n1.7.2 Professional Values\n????????????????????\n\n\n1.7.3 Professional Associations\n????????????????????\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nTrecia enrolled in the MLIS program at McGill University and specialized in knowledge management to learn how to best share knowledge. During her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their business information center, and she learned that efficient knowledge sharing strategies rely on a good understanding of your audience. Knowledge management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and you must constantly re-evaluate to make sure that the collected resources are useful for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now a community services librarian managing the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the Books-by-Mail service. Her job involves public relations and communications, outreach, and programming. One of her main focuses is community led programming, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that best fits their communities’ needs. She finds that programming works best when there is a commitment from the community to participate. Community led programming begins with conversations with patrons to try to determine what programs they would like to see. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, a lot of important skills are required of a successful community services librarian. Communication is important, especially formal communication, everything from social media etiquette to doing media press releases. You need to be able to speak with media outlets as a representative of the library at public tables. Management and leadership skills are also necessary along with time management, project management and knowledge management. Public speaking skills are necessary as you would be giving presentations and teaching staff, as well as running public workshops and programs. Experience with research and report writing is also an asset.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information, the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.9 Archives\n\n1.9.1 Jobs\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian. Some job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public (MLIS skills at work, 2022)\n\n\n1.9.2 Skills\nSome skills you may need to work in these positions include an ability to work independently as well as in a group, knowledge of intellectual property issues, and knowledge of standards of archival description and bibliographic control (MLIS Skills at work, 2022). Dalhousie offers courses in archives that will provide you with the skills you need to be successful in your career such as Archives 1 and 2. You are also able to complete a work practicum or internship within an archive to gain direct experience.\n\n\n1.9.3 Professional values\nSome of the core values of archivists include access and use, accountability, advocacy, diversity, history and memory, preservation, responsible stewardship, selection, service, social responsibility, and sustainability. If you want to learn more about these core values which were published the Society of American Archivists, take a look at their website (Society of American Archivists, 2020).\n\n\n1.9.4 Professional associations\nIf you are looking to join any professional associations for archivists there is the Association of Canadian Archivists, along with the Canadian Council of Archives. Each province also has its own council or association. Nova Scotia has the Council of Nova Scotia Archives. Click on the links to learn more about each association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor Council of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access. Sharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current. Sharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented. The best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.\nThe MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.\nNow let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management.

    "text": "1.4 Public Librarianship\n\n1.4.1 Jobs\nThere are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).\n\n\n1.4.2 Skills\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\n\n\n1.4.3 Professional Values\nThe core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).\n\n\n1.4.4 Professional associations\nThere are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

These include but are not limited to access and reference services librarian, outreach and diversity librarian, materials and image librarian, and staff engagement liaison. Although there are so many different titles within academic librarianship there are some job duties that appear often. These include reference assistance, assisting faculty in research and teaching research, delivering courses on research, creating LibGuides, helping to select which journals to purchase, analyzing usage statistics and outreach and marketing (MLIS Skills at Work, 2022).\n\n\nSkills\nThere are some skills that you should be working on if you are looking to work within an academic library. These include knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet and data applications, knowledge of the open access movement and the scholarly publishing industry, multitasking, interpersonal skills, customer service and knowledge of copyright practices (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\nProfessional values\nWhen it comes to professional values, academic librarianship has very similar values to public librarianship such as access, diversity, preservation, education and privacy (Core values of librarianship, 2019).\n\n\nProfessional Associations\nLibrary associations are formed so that librarians with similar interests can come together to share ideas. Ideas are shared through seminars, conferences, workshops and training courses (Blogger, 2020). If you are looking to work in librarianship it is a good idea to join one or more of these associations. A good starting point for academic librarianship is CAPAL The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians. CAPAL also offers an annual conference which it would be worth attending whether it is virtual or in person.\n\n\nSpecial Librarianship\nLibraries are located in many different organizations and businesses. If you choose to work in special librarianship, you could find yourself within a hospital, a law practice or even a prison. Keep this in mind when thinking about what sort of career you would like to pursue with the MI degree. Law librarianship\n\n\nJobs\nThere are many different job titles that an information manager may have when working in law. Examples of these include law practice and technology librarian and instructional law librarian. Some people choose to acquire a law degree along with their information degree to further their skills. Some job duties you may have working in legal librarianship include assisting the law community in finding and evaluating information, developing instructional programs on legal technologies, teaching law courses, and monitoring vendor communication for new titles (MLIS skills at work, 2022).\n\n\nSkills\nCommon skills that employers search for in legal librarianship include exceptional client service, discretion when dealing with confidential information, knowledge of online legal research platforms, experience working on projects related to digitization, project management and teaching. You can tailor your courses to these skills while in school and find ways to use what you have learned in your interviews upon graduation (MLIS skills at work, 2022)."

Some of the roles that fall under knowledge management include knowledge synthesizer, knowledge analyst, knowledge navigator and of course knowledge manager. Some of the main duties you may encounter within this field are handling a company’s knowledge management operations, formulating a knowledge management strategy, managing knowledge management staff and influencing change within an organization.

During the final term of her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their International Intellectual Properties Division, and there she learned that effective knowledge gathering and sharing strategies rely on a sound understanding of your audiences. Knowledge Management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and constantly re-evaluating knowledge purpose and use to ensure that the collected resources are of value for the people in the organization who are using them.\nTrecia is now the Community Services Librarian, and Managing Branch Librarian of the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the regional Borrow-by-Mail service. In addition, her job portfolio covers the regional areas of responsibilities for Public Relations and Communications, Programming, Outreach, and Services for Adults. One of her main focuses is developing Community-Led programs and services, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that is responsive to their communities' needs. She finds that programming works best when there is engagement with the community to participate. Community-Led programming begins with conversations with the community-at-large and other community service providers to try to determine programs and services of interest and value. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, some important skills required of a successful public librarians and public library staff include communication and leadership. Communication is critically important, especially formal communication skills such as being comfortable with public speaking (to give presentations and leading workshops), understanding the evolving social media etiquette, to crafting effective media releases and grant applications (and reports). Management and leadership skills, along with solid project management experience are key to creating a healthy, responsive, and thriving workplace environment.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information - the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "text": "1.7 Archives\nWorking in archives is a very common path for people taking an MI degree. Archivists may work in all sorts of organizations including corporations, universities, or non-profits. Some roles they may take on include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian.\nWhile archives and libraries have many points in common, they have important difference that often sets them apart as clearly distinct fields. Archival records are very different than bibliographic records. They tend to be created and maintained for different purposes, and guided by a different set of principles and philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nThe School of Information Management offers several archives courses and a an archives certificate that you can complete as part of your MI degree. There are also practicum and internship opportunities available for you to gain experience.\n\n\nSome job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collection to the public. To get more information about the archives field, you can check out the websites of the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Canadian Council of Archives, and the Council of Nova Scotia Archives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor\nCouncil of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access.\nSharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current.\nSharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented.\nThe best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\nThere are many professional associations for you to check out if you are interested in public libraries, such as the Public Library Association (a division of the American Library Association), the Nova Scotia Library Association (free membership for students).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professionals\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents.\nThe Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles.\nThere are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way.\nOne piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management.\nSome of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling.\nThere are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions.\nIf looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to.\nWhile you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for.\nThe best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech focused so it’s important to know how information is managed through IT systems. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.\nThe Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired to a government position. They offer full time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also have the ability to bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html\nThe best advice Stephanie would give is to be open minded and willing to learn constantly. Always try new things and make sure that the work you are doing is aligned with your organizations’ mission and corporate vision."

    "text": "1.8 Museums\nMuseums also often have libraries and archives that can be open to the public (increasingly so with collections being digitized and made available on the web). Depending on the type of museum, these libraries and archives can be part of the collections, or exist to support the museums activities. For example, a good exhibit might rely on having done research on the topic and its social or historical context, or on specific items that are part of the exhibit. Then you can think of museums as just another type of organization where librarian or archivists are needed.\nAnother key role for information professionals in museums involves dealing with information systems and users. Museums increasingly have online collections and databases to support them. These require a set of competencies and skills, such as database management, organization of information, and user-centered web design, that you will be able to develop during your MI degree.\nMore generally, the close relationship between the information and museum fields may be blurry enough that your information degree could help you compete for any type of museum role. especially if you have a background in the arts and humanities, or another area that is relevant for a particular museum.\nTo get a better sense of the jobs available in the museum space, check out the Canadian Museums Association (https://museums.ca/) and their job board."

There are also practicum and internship opportunities available for you to gain experience.\nTo get more information about the archives field, you can check out the websites of the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Canadian Council of Archives, and the Council of Nova Scotia Archives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor\nCouncil of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access.\nSharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current.\nSharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented.\nThe best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building."

All organizations have produce and need information to support their operations, by collecting and organizing data, documents, and archives, and managing information systems that support the day to day activities of organizations. Information professionals also have an educational role, by providing data, information literacy, and information technology training to patrons in public libraries, students, and colleagues in any type of work environment, and by gathering and organizing teaching materials to support educators. Information professionals also play an important role in supporting research in academic, governmental, non-profit, and corporate settings. Information professionals can also play a key role in fulfilling the culture and entertainment mission of organizations such as public libraries and museums.\n\n“Because of differences in goals and in the basic principles that underlie the various disciplines represented in the information profession, it is difficult, if not impossible, to express a single set of values across the information professions.” (Koehler, 2003, p. 109)\n\nStill there is a core set of values that exists within our field and tend to be promoted in our programs, and professional associations. The following are examples of core values in the information profession, adapted from Gorman (2015). These values may reflect the historical focus of the field (and of Goman’s book) on libraries, but they are also broad principles that can be relevant and applied in a wide range fo professional settings.\n\nStewardship\nGathering, organizing, preserving information for future use\nService\nBeing of service to our users, colleagues, and communities\nIntellectual freedom\nProtecting the right of people to hold, share and access ideas without restrictions\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion\nEnsuring that every individual and groups have access to information, can participate in the production of information, and be adequately represented in information.\nPrivacy protecting the privacy of individuals and activities\nLiteracy and learning\nPromoting reading and lifelong learning.\nDemocracy\nSupporting democracy and democratic principles.\nSocial responsibility\nWorking to make the world a better place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to think about\n\n\n\nThink about some of the type of work and organization that interests you as a future information professional.\n\nCan you think of ways in which the roles, values and principles listed would apply to that setting?\nAre there roles or values that are not relevant in this context?\nAre there others values or roles that you can mobilize as an information expert in this context?"

    "section": "2.2 Introduction",
    "text": "2.2 Introduction\nAs we probably all were taught to do when seeking to understand the meaning of a term, let us first turn to a dictionary to obtain a definition of the term \"information\". Here are the definitions offered by the Merriam Webster Dictionary:\n\nKnowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction\nIntelligence, News\nFacts, data\nThe attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something (such as nucleotides in DNA or binary digits in a computer program) that produce specific effects\nA signal or character (as in a communication system or computer) representing data\nSomething (such as a message, experimental data, or a picture) which justifies change in a construct (such as a plan or theory) that represents physical or mental experience or another construct\nA quantitative measure of the content of information\nSpecifically: a numerical quantity that measures the uncertainty in the outcome of an experiment to be performed\nThe communication or reception of knowledge or intelligence\nThe act of informing against a person\nA formal accusation of a crime made by a prosecuting officer as distinguished from an indictment presented by a grand jury\n\n\n2.2.1 A definition of information for the information field\nWhatever name the schools or programs that train information professionals are called (e.g., Information Management, Information Studies, Information Science), most have in common that one word: \"information\". It is thus no surprise that at least a handful of scholars working in these schools or departments have sought to provide some conceptual clarity regarding that word that unites us all. What may be more surprising, however, is that several decades of scholarship and debates have not been successful at achieving a consensus on the definition of information. Still, these conceptual explorations have generated many attempts at such a definition leading us to explore more thoroughly a range of other concepts that are related to it and that have sometimes been used to determine what is (and what is not) information. They have also generated quite an entertaining debate between two scholars, Birger Hjorland, and Marcia Bates, who had very different views on what information was, and what it meant to our field. At the core of their dispute was whether information is to be understood as an objective or subjective phenomenon.\n\n2.2.1.1 The Bates-Hjorland debate\nMarcia Bates believed that all information is natural and exists in the material world of matter and energy and that \"almost anything existing in the universe, that can come into human and other animals' purview, can be experienced as information\" (Bates, 2006, p. 1033). From there, she came up with a glossary of information types:\n\nEmbedded information: information left behind on earth by animals. Includes such things as human created tools, or paths through the woods.\nEncoded information: Natural information that is organized symbolically, linguistically, or is signal based.\nEmbodied information: The corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form.\nExosomatic information: Information that is stored outside of the body.\nExpressed information: The ways in which members of a species communicate including language, scents, calls and gestures.\nKnowledge: Information that has been integrated with other contents of understanding and therefore given meaning.\nRecorded information: Information that has been stored in a durable medium (both communicatory and memorial information). For example, books.\nTrace information: The information that remains after a species is done with it. For example, a no-longer-used wasps' nest.\n\nMany of these definitions are intertwined with each other. For example, all of the knowledge that a person has stored in their memory is encoded in the neural pathways in their brain. The way that life is experienced and remembered is embodied in the degree of consciousness that the person has (Bates, 2006).\nWhile Bates had many definitions for information two of her most debated definitions included information 1 and information 2."

    "section": "2.3 Information: Objective or Subjective?",
    "text": "2.3 Information: Objective or Subjective?\nAccording to Hjørland (2007) There are two basic views of information:\n\nObjective information: information is any difference in patterns of matter and energy\nSubjective/situational information: information is a difference that makes a differnence\n\nLet's look at an example of information 1. Someone waving their hands towards themselves is often culturally construed to mean \"come here\". Although there are situations where someone may not understand this gesture in this way, with Bates' definition it is still considered an objective phenomenon. The movement remains information regardless of whether it is seen or even interpreted (Hjørland, 2007).\nInformation 2 is described as \"some pattern or organization of matter and energy given meaning by a living being\" (Hjørland, 2007, p.1450). The idea that words only have meaning situationally and temporarily coincides with this definition of information but not with information 1. One problem with this definition is that it does not consider how computers also process information not just living beings. Information in computers is not objective because programmers give meaning to the strings of numbers (Hjørland, 2007).\nBirger Hjørland believes that Bates' theory of information is both inadequate and inappropriate for information science. She believes that Bates is trying to have it all by defining information in more than one way. Next let's look at Hjørland's definition of information.\nWhat one person considers information may not be considered information to another person or in another situation. Researchers from different fields will look at the world from different perspectives and will process information through different lenses (Hjørland, 2007).\n\n2.3.1 So, when is information not information?\nIf no one is aware of an object than it cannot be information, it can become information once someone becomes aware of it. Under the situational definition of information, whether or not something is information depends on the circumstances surrounding the document, data, object or event. These things may be defined as information in certain situations but not in others. This idea becomes complicated when you think of how vast the range of information can be, determining if something is informative very difficult. Think of an example of a tree, which can be informative in more than one way. It will represent other trees of its kind, but also the rings inside the trunk provide information about weather patterns. Hjørland states that \"we are unable to say confidently of anything that it could not be information\" (Hjørland, 2007, p. 1451) meaning that everything may well be information.\n\n\n2.3.2 Document\n\n2.3.2.1 Information as a thing\nMichael Buckland describes information in three ways; information-as-thing, information-as-knowledge and information-as-process. Information can be thought of as a thing when it is used to describe an object such as data or documents. They are considered information because they are informative, they impart knowledge or communicate information. Information systems deal directly with information-as-thing; libraries with books, museums with objects.\nWhat then is informative? You can be informed by many different things, in fact pretty much everything around you can be informative including messages, documents objects and events. Brookes (pg. 14, 1979) states that \"the primary source of information is not the literature of the sciences but the observation of the relevant natural phenomena\" (Hjørland, 2007).\n\n\n2.3.2.2 What is a document?\nWith the increase in publications in the late 19th century more techniques were needed to keep track of all of the documents being produced. It was around the early 20th century when the word documentation was adopted to describe this practice. Since then, there has long been a debate around what exactly qualifies as a document. The question is whether the meaning of document should be limited to just texts and printed texts. If the word document can describe a text that is not printed who's to say it can't also describe things that are not texts at all. Throughout the years many different academics have published their ideas on what is and is not a document. In 1934 Paul Otlet wrote in Traité de documentation that \"objects themselves can be regarded as documents if you are informed by observation of them\" (pg. 805). Soon after, in 1935 Walter Schurmeyer stated that a document is any material that is used to extend our knowledge. Similarly, the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation defined a document as \"any source of information, in material form, capable of being used for reference or study or as an authority\" (pg. 805). They include in this definition manuscripts, illustrations and museum specimens among other things (Buckland, 1997).\nSuzanne Briet was involved in the debate for many years, and she defines a document as \"any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon\" (pg. 806). She is well known for her example of an antelope as a document. She discusses how an antelope that is living free in Africa would not be considered a document but once it is captured and put into a zoo it becomes an object of study. At that point it becomes a document as it is now physical evidence used by researchers. Based on this reasoning she describes six objects and determines whether or not they are a document:\nAlthough Briet's rules for determining whether or not an object is a document are not abundantly clear, there are some rules that can be inferred:\n\nA document is physical,\n\n\n\nA document is intentional intentionality; the objects are intended to be treated as evidence.\n\n\n\nThe objects must be processed to be made into documents.\n\n\n\nThe object must be perceived as a document.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 What is an archive?\nArchives have different meanings to different academics (Caswell, 2016). In humanities studies \"the archive denotes a hypothetical wonderland, the first law of what can be said, the system that governs of the appearance of statements as unique events\" (Caswell, 2016, pg. 1?) An archive is historically understood to be passively engaged with the documentation and preservation processes (Fitzgerald et al).

She states that \"the archival record is but a sliver of social memory (Harris, 2002, Pg. 64).

What then would be the specific understanding of information that are most useful for information management? The figure below is a network showing the links between disciplines represented by a large circle and the most frequent keywords containing the word “information” that research publications in these disciplines contain. our field is represented by the orange circle labeled “LIS” (for Library and Information Science).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of this map? Were you able to observe clear disciplinary difference in the use of the term “information”?\nDid the terms linked to the LIS field make sense to you based on what you know about the field? Were some of them surprising?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 A definition of information for the information field?\nWhatever name the schools or programs that train information professionals are called (e.g., Information Management, Information Studies, Information Science), most have in common that one word: \"information\". It is thus no surprise that at least a handful of scholars working in these schools or departments have sought to provide some conceptual clarity regarding that word that unites us all. What may be more surprising, however, is that several decades of scholarship and debates have not been successful at achieving a consensus on the definition of the word information. Still, these conceptual explorations have generated many attempts at such a definition leading us to explore more thoroughly a range of other concepts that are related to it and that have sometimes been used to determine what is (and what is not) information. They have also generated entertaining debates, such as the well-known discussion between Birger Hjørland and Marcia Bates on whether or not an understanding of information as an objective phenomenon is useful for the field. In the next section, we provide an overview of how three scholars of the information disciplines have proposed that we should think about the term information: Marcia Bates, Birger Hjørland, and Michael Buckland (who most of you got acquainted with in week 1 of the organization of information course).\n\n\n2.2.3 Fundamental forms of information\nMarcia Bates believed that all information is natural and exists in the material world of matter and energy and that \"almost anything existing in the universe, that can come into human and other animals' purview, can be experienced as information\" (Bates 2006, 1033). From there, she constructed a glossary of the different forms of information:\n\nEmbedded information: Information left behind on earth by animals. Includes such things as human created tools, or paths through the woods.\nEmbodied information: The corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form.\nEncoded information: Natural information that is organized symbolically, linguistically, or is signal based.\nEnacted information: The pattern of organization of actions of an animal in, and interacting with, is environment, utilizing capabilities and experience from its neural stores.\nExperienced information: The pattern of organization of subjective experience, the feeling of being in life, of an animal.\nExosomatic information: Information that is stored outside of the body.\nExpressed information: The pattern of organization of communicatory scents, calls, gestures, and ultimately, human spoken language used to communicate among members of a species and between species.\nGenetic information: Information contained in the genotype\nGenotype: The genetic constitution of a living thing.\nInformation 1: The pattern of organization of matter and energy\nInformation 2: Some pattern of organization of matter and energy given meaning by a living being.\nKnowledge: Information that has been integrated with other contents of understanding and therefore given meaning.\nNeural-cultural information: Information that has been created by, processed in, or disseminated from animal nervous systems, especially human nervous systems. (Neural information may also be used for lower animals and/or specifically for the nervous system structures that make memory and action possible in general in animals and humans.)\nPhenotype: The genetically and environmentally determined embodiment of a genotype.\nRecorded information: Information that has been stored in a durable medium.\nRepresented information: Natural information that is encoded or embodied.\nTrace information: The information that remains after a species is done with it. For example, a no-longer-used wasps' nest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to read more about the fundamental forms of information and their relevance for the information field according to Marcia Bates, you can read the full article:\nBates, Marcia J. 2006. \"Fundamental Forms of Information.\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 57 (8): 10331045. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20369.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Information: Objective or Subjective?\nAccording to Hjørland (2007) There are two basic views of information:\n\nObjective information: information is any difference (in patterns of matter and energy, as in Bates’ concept of information 1)\nSubjective/situational information: information is a difference that makes a difference\n\nIn his paper, @hjorland_information_2007 criticizes Bates’ fundamental form of information and argues that only subjective information is relevant to the field, and while Bates’ concept of information 2 is compatible with that view, the concept of information 1 is not and, according to Hjørland (2007), should be ignored. Hjørland also argues that Bates’ definition of information 2 is too limited because it does not consider how computers process information, and because the 0s and 1s (the patterns of matter and energy) that computers process are not information in themselves because their interpretation depends on the computer program (what the programmer programmed the strings to represent).\n\n\n2.2.5 So, when is information not information?\nIf no one is aware of an object than it cannot be information, it can become information once someone becomes aware of it. Under the situational definition of information, whether or not something is information depends on the circumstances surrounding the document, data, object or event. These things may be defined as information in certain situations but not in others. This idea becomes complicated when you think of how vast the range of information can be, determining if something is informative very difficult. Think of an example of a tree, which can be informative in more than one way. It will represent other trees of its kind, but also the rings inside the trunk provide information about weather patterns. Hjørland states that \"we are unable to say confidently of anything that it could not be information\" (Hjørland, 2007, p. 1451) meaning that everything may well be information.\n\n\n2.2.6 Document\n\n2.2.6.1 Information as a thing\nMichael Buckland describes information in three ways; information-as-thing, information-as-knowledge and information-as-process. Information can be thought of as a thing when it is used to describe an object such as data or documents. They are considered information because they are informative, they impart knowledge or communicate information. Information systems deal directly with information-as-thing; libraries with books, museums with objects.\nWhat then is informative? You can be informed by many different things, in fact pretty much everything around you can be informative including messages, documents objects and events. Brookes (pg. 14, 1979) states that \"the primary source of information is not the literature of the sciences but the observation of the relevant natural phenomena\" (Hjørland, 2007).\n\n\n2.2.6.2 What is a document?\nWith the increase in publications in the late 19th century more techniques were needed to keep track of all of the documents being produced. It was around the early 20th century when the word documentation was adopted to describe this practice. Since then, there has long been a debate around what exactly qualifies as a document. The question is whether the meaning of document should be limited to just texts and printed texts. If the word document can describe a text that is not printed who's to say it can't also describe things that are not texts at all. Throughout the years many different academics have published their ideas on what is and is not a document. In 1934 Paul Otlet wrote in Traité de documentation that \"objects themselves can be regarded as documents if you are informed by observation of them\" (pg. 805). Soon after, in 1935 Walter Schurmeyer stated that a document is any material that is used to extend our knowledge. Similarly, the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation defined a document as \"any source of information, in material form, capable of being used for reference or study or as an authority\" (pg. 805). They include in this definition manuscripts, illustrations and museum specimens among other things (Buckland, 1997).\nSuzanne Briet was involved in the debate for many years, and she defines a document as \"any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon\" (pg. 806). She is well known for her example of an antelope as a document. She discusses how an antelope that is living free in Africa would not be considered a document but once it is captured and put into a zoo it becomes an object of study. At that point it becomes a document as it is now physical evidence used by researchers. Based on this reasoning she describes six objects and determines whether or not they are a document:\nAlthough Briet's rules for determining whether or not an object is a document are not abundantly clear, there are some rules that can be inferred:\n\nA document is physical,\n\n\n\nA document is intentional (the objects are intended to be treated as evidence).\n\n\n\nThe object must be perceived as a document.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.7 What is an archive?\nArchives have different meanings to different academics (Caswell, 2016). In humanities studies \"the archive denotes a hypothetical wonderland, the first law of what can be said, the system that governs of the appearance of statements as unique events\" (Caswell, 2016, pg. 1?) An archive is historically understood to be passively engaged with the documentation and preservation processes (Fitzgerald et al). Verne Harris does not believe that archives actually reflect reality but only provide a small snapshot of historical events. She states that \"the archival record is but a sliver of social memory (Harris, 2002, Pg. 64). She believes that archives as shaped by the people who create them, the archivists who preserve and make them available and the researchers who use them (Harris, 2002).\nIf information is considered knowledge, then it must be intangible – it cannot be touched or measured (Buckland, 1991).\nInformation as a process occurs when someone is informed of something, changing what they know (Buckland, 1991)."

    "text": "2.5 Data, information, knowledge, and wisdom\nThe wisdom hierarchy is an important part of information sciences. The hierarchy (pictured below) is often described in the form of a pyramid with data on the bottom followed by information, knowledge and wisdom. Many authors agree that the first appearance of the hierarchy was in T.S. Elliot’s poem The Rock.\n\n“Where is the wisdom that we have lost in knowledge?\nWhere is the knowledge that we have lost in information?”\n\nThe hierarchy is used to connect wisdom, knowledge, information and data to one another and to identify how entities at the lower levels transform into the higher levels. The assumption is that the lower-level entities can be used to create the higher-level entities. Under this assumption it would follow that data creates information, information creates knowledge and knowledge creates wisdom. There is not full consensus on the meanings of each section of the pyramid, for example, some authors believe that information and knowledge are the same thing. Bellinger believes that understanding should never be a level of the pyramid and instead is what helps the transition between levels (Rowley, 2007).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) pyramid\n\n\nOne of the more well-known researchers of the Wisdom Hierarchy is Ackoff. Ackoff includes the common elements of the hierarchy in his definition along with an extra level which he calls understanding. The following are Ackoff’s definitions of the hierarchy.\n\nData: symbols representing the properties of events, objects and the environment. It is of no use until it is processed into a relevant form. Data tend to be products of information.\nInformation: information is what is inferred from data. It is contained in the answers to the questions beginning with who, what, where, when and how many.\nKnowledge: is know how. It “is what makes possible the transformation of information into instructions” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2006).\nIntelligence: “the ability to increase efficiency” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2007).\nWisdom: “the ability to increase effectiveness” (pg. 166 Rowley, 2007).\n\nAlthough there are some discrepancies in the definitions of the key elements there are some common elements that show up in many of the definitions.\nMost definitions of data are written in terms of what data lacks. They agree that there is no meaning or value to data because it has no context. They also agree that data is unorganized and unprocessed, it is discrete objects, facts or observations. Another common idea is that data is recorded descriptions of things, events, activities, or transactions (Rowley, 2007).\nCommon words to describe information include format, structure, organization, meaning and value. Many definitions describe information in terms of data. A few other common definitions include:\nInformation is:\n\nFormatted data\nData that makes a subject more understandable\nData that has become meaningful and useful to humans\nOrganized data that now has meaning\nData processed for a purpose\n\nKnowledge has many definitions by different researchers, there is not nearly as much consensus on the definition. Barnes stated that “knowledge is information processed in the mind of an individual” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007) whereas Choo states that “information becomes knowledge through the process of belief structuring or the formation of justified, true beliefs about the world” (pg. 172, Rowley, 2007). If you were to summarize the most common definitions you would find that knowledge can be viewed as a mix of many things including information, understanding, capability, experience, skills and value.\nMany of the authors within information science believe that they are not capable of defining wisdom (Rowley, 2007)."

They are considered information because they are informative, they impart knowledge or communicate information. Pretty much everything around you can be informative, which is problematic for information professionals. Indeed, the information systems that we manage deal directly with information-as-thing and since we cannot deal with everything in the world, we need at some point to make decisions as to what kinds of information-as-thing we choose to engage with. The term document may be useful here. According to Briet (1951), a document is “any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon”. She is well known for her example of an antelope as a document. She discusses how an antelope that is living free in Africa would not be considered a document but once it is captured and put into a zoo it becomes an object of study. At that point it becomes a document as it is now physical evidence used by researchers.

    "text": "2.5 The data, information, knowledge, and wisdom pyramid\nIn our exploration of the concept of information, we came across many other terms such as document, knowledge, understanding, and data. One way to try to make sense of it all is by situating each of these terms in relation to each other. The data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy or pyramid (pictured below) was not developed by scholars in the LIS field, but is useful to us as it offers a visual representation of the relationship between some of terms we encountered so far.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) pyramid\n\n\nMany authors agree that the first appearance of the hierarchy was in T.S. Elliot’s poem The Rock.\n\n“Where is the wisdom that we have lost in knowledge?\nWhere is the knowledge that we have lost in information?”\n\nThe hierarchy is used to connect wisdom, knowledge, information and data to one another and to identify how entities at the higher levels are created from the entities at lower levels. According to the pyramid, data generates information, information generates knowledge and knowledge generates wisdom. However, just as defining information has proven quite challenging, there is no consensus on the definition of each level of the pyramid, no consensus regarding the number of layers that the pyramid should have, and no consensus regarding the hierarchical nature of the relationship between the concepts. (Rowley 2007).\nRowley (2007) reviewed the literature on the pyramid and how each of the concepts were defined. She found that most definitions of data point to it being discrete objects, facts or observations, or recorded descriptions of things, events, activities, or transactions. According to Rowley’s review, researchers describe information in terms of data that has been formatted, processed, used, or given meaning. Knowledge, then, is often defined as information that has been processed in the mind of an individual,and may also include the requirement that this process has generated justified, true beliefs about the world (Rowley 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nIf, according to the pyramid, information is processed data, and knowledge is processed information, then how would you define wisdom?\nDoes good data necessarily lead to good information?\nIn what ways do information professionals deal with each level of the pyramid?\nWhat levels of the pyramids are can be achieved by computers?"

You may come out of this week with an increased sense of clarity or sense of confusion, but what matters most is that you are aware of the ideas behind the terminological mess, and that you reflect on how these ideas may be relevant to you as a future information professional."
