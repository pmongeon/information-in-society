The textbook would not have been possible without the financial support, through an OER grant, of the [Dalhousie Center for Learning and Teaching](https://www.dal.ca/dept/clt.html) and the [Dalhousie Libraries](https://libraries.dal.ca/). It also would not have been possible without the help and support of Dr. Samantha Taylor, senior instructor and co-lead on the project, who orchestrated the writing of the case studies included throughout the book. It also would not have been possible without the hard work of Janine McGregor, Maddie Hare, Poppy Riddle, and Tessa Biesterfeld, alumni from Dalhousieâ€™s Master of Information program, who wrote the case studies and helped draft some of the chapters. Special thanks to Janine McGregor, who played a leading role in the planning and writing of the textbook.
