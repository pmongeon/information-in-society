<p>The purpose of this introductory chapter is to provide an overview of the very diverse range of professional pathways of which your ALA-accredited information management program can lead you. As we will see in this chapter, information management degrees are about a lot more than librarianship and can provide you with many opportunities. Whether you’re interested in libraries, archives, museums or even working as an information manager in a corporation, this chapter will give you an overview of jobs available, the skills you’ll need and what professional values are important for success.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-information-professions"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> What are the information professions?</h3>
<p>The Master of Information, like other similar programs offered in Canada and the United States, is often associated with libraries and librarianship (and rightfully so) because of its accreditation by the American Library Association (ALA). ALA-accredited degrees are generally a requirement for a range of positions in libraries of all kinds and other related organizations. Accordingly, most students reading this chapter are likely to be interested in pursuing a career in librarianship. Many of you, however, are in this program with completely different careers in mind, and you may be surprised by the emphasis on libraries. Perhaps some of you just have no prior thoughts about the program or the field as you are taking this course as an elective, or simply because you ended up here randomly. Whatever group you might find yourself in, now that you are here you might be surprised by the breadth of the discipline and the many professional pathways that it can lead you down. Who knows, maybe you joined the program to be a children services librarian, and will come out of it an aspiring data scientist? So, what are the information professions? Marcia Bates (2015) referred to our discipline as a meta-discipline that spans across the entire spectrum of traditional research disciplines, from the Arts and Humanities to the Natural Science. While it is by no means comprehensive, this figure from Bates (2015) was an attempt to illustrate the breath of the discipline by situating many of the sub-disciplines across that spectrum.</p>
<p>The diversity of the information profession can also be observed through the many job titles that the MLIS jobs report shows.</p>
<p>This degree does not just lead to librarianship or working as an archivist, in fact there are many different job titles that an MI can lead to. The following is a diverse list of job titles that you may find when looking for work in the MI field. Why don’t you take a look through these titles and see if any of them interest you, and then do a little bit of research to learn more?</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="employment-sectors"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Employment sectors</h2>
<p>The following pie chart is based on an American study (report 2022), but it still shows how important the library sector remains in terms of career opportunities for information management graduates, while also highlighting the diversity of sectors in which you may end up finding employment.</p>
</section>
<section id="skills-to-succeed-as-an-information-professional" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="skills-to-succeed-as-an-information-professional"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Skills to succeed as an information professional</h2>
<p>Although we will narrow in on a few different career options in the following sections, there are some core skills that have been mentioned as valuable regardless of the direction you choose. San Jose State University created a report titled MLIS Skills at Work (2022), in which they analyzed job postings to learn more about the skills required of information professions. Two things which they found to be valuable regardless of the direction you take is previous experience and leadership skills. They suggest that students try to work as an intern during their Master’s degree as well as sign up for leadership positions in student societies. The report also mentions that remote and hybrid work is becoming more common, so if that is something you would like in a job, consider seeking those roles out upon graduation. Lastly, the report states that many employers are focusing more on their EDI efforts (equity, diversity and inclusion) and may ask applicants to provide a statement of commitment explaining how they will foster EDI in the workplace. Luckily, EDI elements are also being added to most courses in MI degrees making it easier for you to think this through while you complete your degree.</p>
<p>The MLIS skills at work report also includes information on what skills are most in demand for the IM profession in general. The following bar charts shows which general and LIS skills are most in demand for careers in information management. Take a look at these skills and think about how you can gain them throughout your degree. Think about what courses you could take to hone them or what extracurriculars are important to you.</p>
<p>Now let’s dig deeper into some of the directions that this degree can take you. In the following section we will provide a deeper overview of different sectors within information management. You can learn more about the different roles, job duties you may encounter and the skills you will need to be successful. There is also more information on the professional values of each sector and the professional associations that you may be able to join.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jobs"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Jobs</h3>
<p>There are many different roles that can be taken on within a public library. Some of these roles don’t require a master’s degree, such as library clerk, but many do. One can work in circulation, programming, or collections development. The actual titles of the roles will differ based on the system you are working in. For example, Halifax public libraries has roles such as Senior Service Manager and Manager of Programming and Community Engagement (cite HPL). Some job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include organizing the collection, developing community partnerships, providing research and recommendations to patrons, helping patrons with technology, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses (MLIS Skills at work).</p>

<h3 data-number="1.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="skills"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Skills</h3>
<p>Some skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.</p>

<section id="professional-values" class="level3" data-number="1.4.3">
<h3 data-number="1.4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="professional-values"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Professional Values</h3>
<p>The core values of Librarianship can be found on the ALA website. These include access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility and sustainability. Each library system will have its own set of core values unique to each organization. For example, Halifax Public Libraries’ values center on diversity, service, access, and digital literacy (Halifax Public Libraries, n.d.).</p>

<section id="professional-associations" class="level3" data-number="1.4.4">
<h3 data-number="1.4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="professional-associations"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.4</span> Professional associations</h3>
<p>There are many different professional associations for public librarianship. Many are location specific so you can always look up to see what associations exist in your area. The American Library Association is one of the largest and most common library associations. If you want to learn more about the ALA you can do so on their website. There is also a division of the ALA which is called the Public Library Association. Nova Scotia has its own library association as well – The Nova Scotia Library Association (NSLA). Its free for students to join and they offer different lectures and webinars. They also host an annual conference. This year, 2022, the conference will be held in Sydney Nova Scotia from October 14th – October 16th, with the theme “Librarians. Connections. Communities”. Check back in the future to see when and where the conference will be held in the coming years.</p>

<p>Dyan Bader<br>
Manager<br>
Systems &amp; Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library</p>
<p>As the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside of Halifax, which are grouped in eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems that these libraries use every day including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. In the past, each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system, but during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the 8 regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 and expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system Dyan’s team must work together with the different regions to ensure there is consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made, since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents. The Nova Scotia Provincial library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles. There are certain skills that would be beneficial to those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way. One piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what you are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloguing. Try your best to stick to those things and hopefully you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services as well as a Masters certificate in project management. Some of your first jobs can really shape your career. She also suggests being open to taking jobs in less urban areas as you are often able to gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a larger library. A lot of times when you enter a larger or more structured environment you can be hemmed in by your job description, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this huge project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.</p>

As the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR and promotions as well as community outreach including volunteer services. He oversees all of the programming at each branch as well as IT and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training and occasionally scheduling. There are two main sides to this position; the public side and the staff side. When working with the public, Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions. If looking to work in a similar role it’s important that one has time management skills and people skills. In this position there are a lot of competing demands on your time such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s important to be able to recognize that people all have different communication styles and people may not interpret what you say in the way you mean for them to. While you are still in school it’s important to take advantage of student opportunities such as joining professional organizations. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that there are certain courses within an MI degree that would be very useful for this job. Community led services was one of them, as it’s important to respond to your community’s needs appropriately. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh young collection that is responsive to what people are looking for. The best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way you’ll gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain the job he has now. He also believes that it’s important to listen if your gut is telling you that your current direction isn’t right for you, you shouldn’t stay in a job that you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction.</p>

<p>Stephanie Bilodeau<br>
Manager, Open Government and Data Governance<br>
Royal Canadian Mounted Police – IM/IT Program</p>
<p>Stephanie wears two hats with her job at the RCMP, she is the manager of Open Government and the manager of Data Governance. There is a big need for these positions because programmers created systems to store data but more needs to be done to organize and manage that data. They have found that when using these systems things aren’t accurate, queries are not always pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have way too much data as it hasn’t been managed or disposed of or cleaned in years creating issues of privacy. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.</p>
<p>Stephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the employees of the department helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision making with those that have authority and responsibility in regards to the data and/or information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest in an effort to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including making sure that information is protected, and publishing information that is relevant. In an effort to enhance democracy all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.</p>
<p>If you would like to work in a similar position it is important that you are a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. You need to be organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech focused so it’s important to know how information is managed through IT systems. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.</p>
<p>The Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired to a government position. They offer full time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also have the ability to bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.<br>
https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html</p>
<p>The best advice Stephanie would give is to be open minded and willing to learn constantly. Always try new things and make sure that the work you are doing is aligned with your organizations’ mission and corporate vision.</p>

<p>Trecia enrolled in the MLIS program at McGill University and specialized in knowledge management to learn how to best share knowledge. During her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their business information center, and she learned that efficient knowledge sharing strategies rely on a good understanding of your audience. Knowledge management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and you must constantly re-evaluate to make sure that the collected resources are useful for the people in the organization who are using them.</p>
<p>Trecia is now a community services librarian managing the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries, and the Books-by-Mail service. Her job involves public relations and communications, outreach, and programming. One of her main focuses is community led programming, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming that best fits their communities’ needs. She finds that programming works best when there is a commitment from the community to participate. Community led programming begins with conversations with patrons to try to determine what programs they would like to see. This is the key to building responsive public library services.</p>
<p>According to Trecia, a lot of important skills are required of a successful community services librarian. Communication is important, especially formal communication, everything from social media etiquette to doing media press releases. You need to be able to speak with media outlets as a representative of the library at public tables. Management and leadership skills are also necessary along with time management, project management and knowledge management. Public speaking skills are necessary as you would be giving presentations and teaching staff, as well as running public workshops and programs. Experience with research and report writing is also an asset.</p>
<p>To set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information, the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests.</p>

<p>Sharon Murray<br>
Archives Advisor Council of Nova Scotia Archives</p>
<p>Although Sharon does not hold an MI degree, the job she has is very relevant to people within the program and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives digitizing items for improved access. She was very systematically processing the photographic records at the archives she worked in and creating databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She originally picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives and began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found that it was eye opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true meaningful access is provided. While in this role she digitized several thousand photographs. Her and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access. Sharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives is much different. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The purpose of the organization is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia there are around 75 archives that are members which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers a suite of courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills needed to manage their archive. Sharon teaches the bulk of the courses offered with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession so that she can ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current. Sharon describes the two most important skills in the archives profession currently as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) as well as knowledge of digital preservation and access. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they are acknowledging their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that going forward they are doing the right thing by endeavoring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. As a profession they are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper based records but digital content that must be preserved. There will be a lot more digital born content which will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also important for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service oriented. The best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field as it will help you to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be useful to the community. She also suggests looking outside of Halifax for summer work positions as a lot of these small organizations are looking for help. You will get the opportunity to work on many different aspects of the archive and will likely learn a lot about community building.</p>
