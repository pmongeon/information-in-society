<p>This chapter briefly introduces the themes that we will explore in more depth in the rest of the textbook. More specifically, it introduces the concept of the information society and describes four fundamental types of information issues we deal with in our individual, professional and social lives.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-information-society"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> The information society</h2>
<p>The information society is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijAYN9zVnwg&amp;ab_channel=infosocietyVEVO">a band from the 1980s</a>, but it is also a type of society that succeeds the industrial society and in which information plays a dominant role. Theorists of the information society have focused on five dimensions of the information society <span class="citation" data-cites="webster_definitions_2014">(<a href="#ref-webster_definitions_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Webster 2014</a>)</span>:</p>
<p>The <strong>technological</strong> dimension of the information society is reflected in the growth of information technologies such as personal computers, smartphones, and the internet, which are now ubiquitous. The <strong>economic</strong> dimension of the information society emphasizes the dominance of information and knowledge industries and the increased share of countries’ GDP they generate. The <strong>occupational</strong> dimension is demonstrated by the rise of service industries, and highlights that in information societies, the majority of employees are not involved in the production of tangible goods. The <strong>spatio-temporal</strong> dimension of the information society is centered around networks, digital technologies, and hyper-connectivity that transcend some of the time and space constraints of the physical world. Think, for example, of how information technologies allow you to engage with groups distributed around the globe or attend a live event taking place in Australia or Norway no matter where you are in the world. Think of how in the middle of the night, you can virtually be somewhere where it is the middle of the day. The <strong>cultural</strong> dimension of the information society points to the role of information in the production and reproduction of culture and individual and collective identities. Finally, the <strong>theoretical knowledge</strong> dimension emphasizes the rise of evidence-based practice and the centrality of data, information and knowledge as the increasingly dominant drivers of individual and collective action.</p>
<p>These dimensions are not independent from one another and are in fact all intertwined, so it can be difficult to consider one without the others. Still, they allow us to consider our world and the kind of problems we are dealing with from different angles, which can help us achieve a more holistic perspective on information and its role in society, and perhaps better solutions to the information problems that we will tackle as information professionals.</p>

<p>Despite being a little bit dated and not written for an information science audience, the following book (which used to be the foundation of the course) can be a useful resource if you are interested in getting an overview of the main theories of the information societies that have been proposed by scholars over the last 50 years or so.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-information-issues"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Types of information issues</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter and class, we explored the concept of information. We situated it in relation to dozens of other related concepts, which I hope helped you expand your understanding of how information manifests itself in the different spheres of society. No matter where we look in this complex conceptual landscape, we can find opportunities and challenges for information professionals, or let’s call them “information issues” for us to tackle. I would argue that are three fundamental forms of information issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Issues of information <strong>access</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Issues of information <strong>quantity</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Issues of information <strong>quality</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Issues of information <strong>behaviour</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these will come back in one way or another in the following chapters, so the goal is to provide a high-level overview and introduce some topics we will dive more deeply into later on.</p>
<section id="access-issues" class="level3" data-number="3.3.1">
<h3 data-number="3.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="access-issues"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Access issues</h3>
<p>Article 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”. Also, Article 27.1 is states that “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits”. These two points are closely tied to several of the core values of the field presented in chapter 1, such as stewardship and intellectual freedom. The term <strong>participate</strong> in Article 27.1 can be related to access in terms of having access to the means of production and dissemination of information (e.g., computer, smartphone, internet).</p>
<p>Despite being considered a universal human right, there are still many ways in which access to information is limited in the world today. Some of the constraints can be <strong>physical</strong> when information is recorded on a non-digital medium and stored in a specific location, which may or may not be easily accessed, or when digital information resources are behind a paywall. Access to information is at the core of the mission of libraries that build collections of physical and digital information resources so the communities they serve can access them. This also applies to other settings in which information professionals work; there is often (if not always) an information user, with more or less explicit and clearly defined information needs, and an information professional whose role may be to ensure that the user has access to the information they need to fulfill those information needs.</p>

<p>Do you think that all information should be accessible to everyone? If not, what kind of information do you think should not accessible to all? How can you reconcile the notion that some information should not be accessible to all with the idea of information as a human right?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another critical issue to consider is the <strong>inequalities</strong> in access to information. Since information is crucial for personal, social and professional development and for people to thrive in the information society, differences in access to information based on socio-demographic factors can contribute to creating or reinforcing existing inequalities. That is one of the reasons why equity, diversity, and inclusion is such an important topic in our field and one that you will find in many of your courses.</p>
<p>The unequal access to information is often referred to as the <strong>digital divide</strong>, defined as “the gap between individuals, households, business and geographic areas at different socioeconomic levels with regard both to their opportunities to access information and communication technologies and to their use of the internet for a wide variety of activities” (OECD, 2001). You can check out the network readiness index (<a href="https://networkreadinessindex.org/" class="uri">https://networkreadinessindex.org/</a>) to see how countries are doing in terms of making digital infrastructure, connectivity and governance. Even within a single country, demographic factors can have a strong relationship with physical access to information and information technology. Income, age, gender, education and location are all predictors of whether or not people have access to the internet. And varying levels of information literacy may lead members of some social groups not to access information even when it is available <span class="citation" data-cites="sparks_what_2013">(<a href="#ref-sparks_what_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Sparks 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Access is also closely linked to the <strong>literacy</strong> concepts family (information literacy, data literacy, digital literacy, etc.), which is core to the information professions, especially in public and academic librarianship. That is where language and the ability to read and write come in, as one cannot have access to information if it is in a language that they do not understand or if it is in a written format and they don’t know how to read. Similarly, people cannot participate in the information society if they don’t have the basic ability to communicate. Teaching people how to read and write and use information technologies is not typically understood as the role of information professionals. However, public libraries are often used as community centers where such training can occur.</p>

<p>There is a lot of information in the world, and a lot of new information is produced every day (that is, of course, if you subscribe to the notion of information as a thing. Otherwise, we could rephrase this and say that there is a lot of information happening every day). Anyways, the following two quotes can help us grasp just how much information we are talking about.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>The amount of information being created every two days is equivalent to that created from the dawn of civilization until the year 2003</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="benselin_information_2016">(<a href="#ref-benselin_information_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Benselin and Ragsdell 2016</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Living in a world of <strong>information abundance</strong>, it may be difficult to imagine that we could still find ourselves in situations of <strong>information scarcity</strong>. Isn’t finding the information we need as simple as picking up our smartphones and “googling” whatever we want to know?</p>

<p>Can you think of a situation in which you found yourself not finding (or having a lot of difficulty finding) the information that you needed? How did you feel? How did you cope with the situation? What was the outcome?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You may think that the general abundance of information is a good thing. After all, isn’t information the basis of all (or most) knowledge and of better “informed” decisions? Can there be too much of a good thing as information?</p>
<div class="callout-tip callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">

<p>Can you think of a situation in which you found yourself having too much information? What was the context? How did you feel? How did you cope with the situation? What was the outcome?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The idea that there is a point where more information is just too much information is often called <strong>information overload.</strong> This is by no means a new phenomenon, but as technological developments increase our capacity to produce, disseminate and store information, so does the amount of information that the average human is exposed to and needs (or believes they need) to process or manage. When the amount of information exceeds our capacity for processing and managing it, we are in a situation of information overload <span class="citation" data-cites="misra_psychological_2012">(<a href="#ref-misra_psychological_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Misra and Stokols 2012</a>)</span>. Information overload can cause many negative outcomes, including psychological stress, exhaustion, negative affect, decreased productivity <span class="citation" data-cites="matthes_too_2020">(<a href="#ref-matthes_too_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Matthes et al. 2020</a>)</span>, information addiction, distraction, and symptoms similar to attention deficit disorder <span class="citation" data-cites="bawden_dark_2009">(<a href="#ref-bawden_dark_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Bawden and Robinson 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The following video is about how having too much choice leads to poorer decisions or less satisfaction about our decisions, which the speaker calls the “paradox of choice”. I think it also applies to information and that we have, in fact, a “paradox of information”.</p>

<p>Access to information is great, and access to a lot of information is even better (with some caveats, as we discussed above). However, another fundamental concern with our information society is the quality of the information available to us. Again, if information is the basis of all (or most) knowledge and better “informed” decisions, what happens if the information we receive is inaccurate or simply false? We may use our filtering mechanisms or critical thinking skills and reject that information. In this case, we have wasted some time. But what if we fail to recognize the poor quality of the information we receive and use it as a basis to form an important decision or to shape our worldview?</p>
<p>The widespread presence and spread of <strong>misinformation</strong> (and related concepts such as disinformation and fake news) has been facilitated by the rise of the internet and other information technologies that make the production and dissemination of information accessible to all. <span class="citation" data-cites="bran_learning_2021">Bran et al. (<a href="#ref-bran_learning_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> used the term Information pollution or ‘infollution’ to describe the growing problem of the spread of unwanted messages in society in quantity large enough to cause significant affect human and social activities, and consider conspiracy theories, propaganda, memes and memetic warfare, and ideological manipulation as forms of infollution that can result in wasted time, physical and mental health issues and stress or addiction. No matter how one calls it or in what shape or form it presents itself, misinformation is one of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170301-lies-propaganda-and-fake-news-a-grand-challenge-of-our-age">greatest challenges of our age</a>.</p>
<p>There are other ways to think about information quality that come short of falling under the “misinformation” label. For example, we may consider that information is of poor quality when it is, for one reason or another, not effective in achieving the desired goal (e.g., to inform, to increase knowledge, to make a decision). It may also be useful to think about information not only in terms of a single information unit (e.g., a news article or a single statement in a text) but also in terms of collections of information units (e.g., a library collection, a set of resources used to support a decision).</p>

<p>Information issues can lead to <strong>Information anxiety,</strong> defined as the state “produced by the ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand. It is the black hole between data and knowledge, and it happens when information doesn’t tell us what we want or need to know” <span class="citation" data-cites="naveed_towards_2020">(<a href="#ref-naveed_towards_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Naveed 2020, 66</a>)</span>. Its symptoms may include the inability to keep up with the information we are presented, frustration over the quality of information available, guilt about not being better informed, or the desire to be the first to know.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="behaviour-issues"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Behaviour issues</h3>
<p>So far, we have mainly discussed issues related to the information itself and its accessibility, quantity and quality. However, the last fundamental form of information relates not to the information itself and its characteristics but to how we use it or interact with it: our <strong>information behaviour</strong>.</p>
<p>Suppose we side with <span class="citation" data-cites="hjorland_information_2007">Hjørland (<a href="#ref-hjorland_information_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> and consider that only the subjective/situational concept of information is helpful for information professionals. Then we must conclude that all information phenomena that information professionals care about involve humans (or computers) that seek, evaluate, filter, store, organize, produce, disseminate, share, use, or react to information in their own way depending on the context. In that case, the information world we live in (and all its issues of access, quantity, and quality) is the product of individual or group behaviour. However, our information behaviour has effects that transcend the informational world and can positively or negatively affect our individual and collective lives.</p>

<p>Can you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a negative impact on our lives or the lives of others?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The notion of <strong>intent</strong> is important to consider when thinking about information and the outcomes of our information behaviour. For example, a corporation may intentionally reduce access to information by creating a paywall around highly valuable information. We may produce and disseminate a lot (quantity) of free content (access) with catchy titles but a low informative value (quality) to attract readers and generate ad revenues (intent). A social media user may intentionally post information (true or false) about someone else in order to hurt them. We may intentionally or unintentionally produce or share misinformation. Finally, we may intend to fulfill an information need by gathering a lot of information resources, but we end up causing information overload, analysis paralysis, or anxiety for ourselves or our users or clients.</p>

<p><strong>Wren Reilly (she/her)</strong> is a 28-year-old from Collingwood, a small town in Ontario. Wren is an aspiring data manager hoping to work in a position that allows her to work independently and utilize her organizational skills. Wren hopes that her undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Toronto will lend itself well to her future career in data management. She is a logical, individualistic, and introverted individual who works well under pressure. Wren worked for a couple of small new businesses throughout her 20s, helping with programming, and worked in tech support for a larger organization. She plans to work with an organization one day where she can use the knowledge she will gain of databases to deal with big data.</p>
<p><strong>Dante de Luca (he/they)</strong> is a 24-year-old from Calgary, Alberta and aspiring public librarian. Dante has an undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Calgary. They considered a career in social work before realizing that public librarianship would allow them to combine their love of helping others with their desire to engage with the community. Dante has always had a passion for libraries. They grew up going to their local library every Saturday with their mom. Throughout high school they volunteered as a reading buddy for younger children and volunteered with newcomers through the English language learning programs at the Calgary Central Library during their undergraduate degree. In the years before deciding to return to school to pursue a graduate degree Dante worked as a front desk administrator at a dog sled tour company in Canmore Alberta. Dante is an extroverted and caring individual who has leadership qualities and aims to one day be the chief executive librarian of a system of libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Jude Jamieson (he/him)</strong> is a 31-year-old originally from Cape Breton Nova Scotia. Jude has an undergraduate degree in History from Acadia University. He spent his twenties trying to decide what direction he wants his career to go. He has worn many hats including baker, server and research assistant. Ultimately, he decided that he wanted to pursue further education to work as an archivist. He feels that his love of history and research will suit this profession well. Jude has utilized the archives in the past, working with the archivist at Acadia when he was writing his undergraduate thesis. He loves the idea of organizing and working with the artifacts that make up our past. Jude is an introverted, thoughtful and nostalgic individual and would love to work as a digital archivist.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Mina Brown (she/they)</strong> is a 40-year-old who grew up in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Tracy received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Amsterdam. Before deciding to apply for the MI program Tracy worked as a professional in a non-profit organization, as well as a digital content manager. Her job requires this sort of confident, extroverted, team-player visage, which she does well, but then she needs and really enjoys the quiet and focus of just doing the work alone. She enjoys being highly focused and sees this as a strength. Tracy is pursuing a career in knowledge management, preferably with a non-profit in the arts.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting"><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Setting</h3>
<p>You, Wren, Dante, Jude and Tracy have all just started your first year as Master of Information Students at Dalhousie University. You met during the orientation process put on by the university. While sitting on the patio at a pub down by the waterfront you discuss what led each of you to the information profession or back to school.</p>
<p>You all sit down and order your food and drinks. You are curious and ask the others: What brought you to the MI program?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Well, my undergraduate degree was in history and focused on a Nova Scotian context. When I finished my degree I worked as a baker for a few years, but I kept picking up side-projects with the local archives in my town; transcribing documents online, digitizing my family’s cookbooks. After a while, I figured that if this was something I was interested in, I should pursue it as a career!</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: That’s so cool how you were able to take your interests and turn them into career passions! For me, I’ve always loved to read, and I’ve dreamed of opening a bookstore and coffee shop for years. I ended up going to school for psychology and business but realized along the way that opening a business wasn’t for me. I talked to a family friend who works as a librarian, and it seemed like the perfect fit honestly. I would still get to work with books and people but without the stress of keeping a business afloat. I just want to make the world a better place and I think libraries can really help make that possible. Creating a space where people of all backgrounds can gather, and where information and knowledge are free is so important! I know that to become a librarian I’ll need the ALA accreditation so that affected my decision to apply to Dalhousie.</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: I also thought the ALA accreditation would be great to have as an archivist. Looking over the competencies that are developed through this degree, it seemed that they would all be directly relevant to the skills I would need to be successful in my career.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: I’m really interested in the technology part of the program and my goal is to land a data science position in a tech firm, and then move up to a management role. I have a background in computer science and what attracted me to the program is that it brings together technology, management, information, and people in a way that will be more beneficial for me than the computer science programs which are very focused on technology.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: I came here after a career in non-profits. I have a fine arts degree and if you’re not a gallery or corporate artist, then you work in non-profits. But I wasn’t really trained formally for dealing with an organization’s challenges. I mean, I can creatively problem solve, which they seem to appreciate, but honestly, just as much fails as often as it works, and I don’t even know why. So, while I really like the non-profit I was with and I think their cause is amazing, I came back to school because I felt like every day I was just winging it. It would be nice to know how things should and can work, rather than hoping they work!</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: That’s a good reason to apply to school, Tracy! Say, did our order get put through? I guess they forgot, it’s been like 45 minutes!</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: Ya, but look how busy it is here. The servers are run off their feet, I bet their communication is not ideal with this much going on.</p>
<p>Looking around, they recognize the importance of information flows in this restaurant and in all kinds of businesses. They realize that they have all experienced related issues in their previous careers.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: I totally understand what it’s like to have issues with informational flow. When I worked at a dog sled tour company there was always issues with the communication between the front desk staff and the customers. There was a tight cancellation policy and if it wasn’t understood properly customers would end up paying for tours they couldn’t attend, and boy, did that make them angry! No one wants to feel like they’ve wasted $400!</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Jeez, I bet that caused a lot of headaches for the front desk! What did you think could have been done better to avoid those issues?</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: I think if we had had a database and computer system that would keeps track of our client and bookings and sent out automated confirmation emails there would be a lot less room for human error and a better flow of communication! I found that the owners weren’t too open to my suggestions though so I made a point of returning to school so that I could bring my ideas to a new organization!</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Yeah, that’s a really good reason to quit! I used to work as a baker and would often deal with supply chain issues. It wasn’t always communicated to us properly what was and wasn’t available, so it was hard to plan our menu. Customers weren’t always happy when we couldn’t have their favorite baked good available, but we tried our best!</p>
<p><strong>Tracy</strong>: People can be really grumpy in the morning before their morning cup and bagel, that’s for sure! When I worked at the non-profit, we spent a lot of time applying for grants and often found that the instructions for what was expected were not clear. This made it so hard to gain the funding we required. Every time I wrote one for our organization, I felt like I was just making this stuff up, as I never really knew what people were working on in our organization, or what projects they wanted to get done. Also, we were all over the place with people in countries around the globe – it was impossible to meet them all let alone know what their ambitions were.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Wow, I never really thought about all the ways that lack of communication or misunderstandings can really affect how so many businesses are run. I worked on several coding projects during my undergrad, and we had different people working on the same code and sometimes that would be a mess when we didn’t have a shared understanding of the project’s goal, or when people didn’t document their changes properly. That can get very inefficient, and frustrating!</p>
