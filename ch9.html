<p>Earlier in the semester we spoke about information quality and how the information we consume has the ability to shape our worldviews. In this chapter we will return to this issue and dive deeper into the definitions of misinformation, disinformation and fake news. We will consider the origins of misinformation, how it spreads, and what the societal costs are. Lastly, we will discuss how to reduce the impact of misinformation and what we as information professionals can do.</p>

<p>The main difference between misinformation and disinformation is the intent behind it. Misinformation occurs when someone unknowingly shares false information under the pretense that it is true whereas disinformation occurs when someone deliberately creates and shares information they know is false <span class="citation" data-cites="depaor2020">(<a href="#ref-depaor2020" role="doc-biblioref">De Paor and Heravi 2020</a>)</span>. Fake news has been defined in many different ways but generally can be seen as false news articles that mislead the reader <span class="citation" data-cites="depaor2020">(<a href="#ref-depaor2020" role="doc-biblioref">De Paor and Heravi 2020</a>)</span>. Fake news is co-constructed by its audience, because if the audience does not believe it then it automatically becomes fiction. There are many different kinds of fake news including news satire, news parody, news fabrication, advertising and propaganda. A major problem is that creators of fake news are making money off of this societal trend and are therefore motivated to make believable false news stories <span class="citation" data-cites="depaor2020">(<a href="#ref-depaor2020" role="doc-biblioref">De Paor and Heravi 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Misinformation can arise in many different ways. One way is that rumors and fiction may be considered to be true. People are more likely to pass on information that evokes emotion regardless of if it is truthful. This is a common occurrence with information gleaned through gossip. People may also read fictional stories and believe that what they are reading is true <span class="citation" data-cites="lewandowsky_misinformation_2012">(<a href="#ref-lewandowsky_misinformation_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lewandowsky et al. 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The government and politicians are also known to spread misinformation. People are often unable to determine which information is true and false, especially surrounding elections. People often expect to encounter some misinformation during elections <span class="citation" data-cites="lewandowsky_misinformation_2012">(<a href="#ref-lewandowsky_misinformation_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lewandowsky et al. 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The media, including social media are also spreaders of misinformation. The media can take true information from scientific studies and twist it in a way that can be misinterpreted- by oversimplifying, misrepresenting or over-dramatizing scientific results. The media often tries to portray balanced stories but sometimes this can create misleading outcomes. Social media too is a huge spreader of misinformation. Anyone can post information online without professional editors or fact checkers verifying the truthfulness of their statements. Hoax websites exist solely to spread mis- and disinformation. Selective exposure may also occur if people are only seeking out media sources that confirm their existing beliefs <span class="citation" data-cites="lewandowsky_misinformation_2012">(<a href="#ref-lewandowsky_misinformation_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lewandowsky et al. 2012</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The internet creates filter bubbles in which people’s social media feeds and Google searches are filtered to only include information that is in line with their currently existing beliefs. In the Ted Talk below, Eli Pariser describes filter bubbles as “your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online”. The main problem with this is that people are not shown any opposing views which only serves to strengthen their current views. If the views that are held are false, they will still be shown more information that aligns with them.</p>

<p><br> People believe and spread misinformation for a myriad of reasons. People often don’t know that something is misinformation until it is corrected and even then, they may have a hard time believing the corrected information if it does not align with their beliefs. Worldview and personal ideology play a role in people’s willingness to believe misinformation- people will often argue anything that goes against their pre-existing worldview <span class="citation" data-cites="lewandowsky_misinformation_2012">(<a href="#ref-lewandowsky_misinformation_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lewandowsky et al. 2012</a>)</span>. People also struggle to identify whether or not a source is reliable. If an information source is persuasive people are more likely to believe that it is credible. People so rarely look into their sources that most often people remember the gist of the information they read but not the source it came from. This shows how important it is for people to consider the sources they are getting their information from and whether they may be biases or misleading. It has also been shown that retractions often don’t work – people sometimes believe the information more after a retraction because they have now been repeatedly exposed to it. This is because the more familiar information becomes the truer it can seem <span class="citation" data-cites="lewandowsky_misinformation_2012">(<a href="#ref-lewandowsky_misinformation_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lewandowsky et al. 2012</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>There are many societal costs of misinformation and disinformation. One major one is that if a large majority believe in misinformation, then that misinformation can shape political decisions. This would not be in the best interest of society.</p>

<p>There are many ways to combat misinformation and help people to make more informed decisions about what they read and what they believe. One way to do this is to warn people when they receive information that it may be untrue. If the warning is given before the false information, it is more helpful. If a retraction is necessary, it’s important that it be repeated so that the true information becomes more memorable. Another good way to combat misinformation is to provide an alternative explanation – one that is plausible and explains why the misinformation was considered true originally. Lastly, promoting healthy skepticism can help reduce people’s susceptibility to misinformation because it makes people question the information they are given <span class="citation" data-cites="lewandowsky_misinformation_2012">(<a href="#ref-lewandowsky_misinformation_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lewandowsky et al. 2012</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Librarians can be seen as working on the front lines of the battle against misinformation. In the past, librarians acted as fact checkers, but going forward they must act as educators. This is because librarians are incapable of keeping up with the level of misinformation online. One way to do this is to hold information literacy classes at the library. Information literacy has been cited as an effective way to deal with misinformation and fake news. It has been defined as “the ability to think critically and make balanced judgements about any information we find and use” <span class="citation" data-cites="depaor2020">(<a href="#ref-depaor2020" role="doc-biblioref">De Paor and Heravi 2020, 4</a>)</span> . Information literacy is a tool of empowerment because it provides people with the skills they need to make informed decisions and participate fully in society. Other ways that librarians can help combat fake news is through fact checking websites, and creating LibGuides.</p>

<p><em>Jude, always the activist and helpful community member, offers help to another member of an online forum who has been trying to start a podcast. Jude has had extensive experience creating and distributing podcasts as part of working with the LGBTQ Archives and helped community members create their own podcast platforms. After getting the infrastructure set-up and hearing from the forum member that the podcasts were doing well, a month later, Jude finally has time to listen in on the latest episode. Alarmed, Jude calls Dante late at night.</em></p>
<p>*The phone rings, waking Dante up*</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: Jude, I really hope you’re either stranded in a desert somewhere or won the lottery, because it’s 2am!</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Hey Dante, I’m sorry to wake you. Unfortunately, neither, though I kind of wish I was in the middle of a desert right now. I need to talk to you about something, would you mind lending an ear?</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: Not at all, friend. You just have to promise me that if you do discover that you won the lottery at two in the morning one day, I’m still first on your list of people to call. But my ears are all yours.</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: You got it buddy. Well, I guess to summarize, you know that podcast I was helping to get off the ground?</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: Oh yeah, the one run by the guy you met on that online forum you’re a part of?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Exactly. Well, I’ve been so busy with work and my own personal projects that I haven’t really been keeping tabs on it. It’s been a few months since I’ve listened to an episode, but I’ve heard from a few acquaintances that the podcast was doing well.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: That’s great, Jude! Well done. You’re like King Midas of going viral! Everything you apply yourself to just takes off!</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Thanks, Dante. I wish this time it didn’t, though. I was doing some work late tonight and put the latest episode on in the background. There was some pretty harmful content to the LGBTQ community on it. I’m abhorred. I can’t believe I was a part of setting up the infrastructure for this show and contributed to giving this guy a platform to spread messaging this alarming.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: Oh no. That’s terrible. I’m sorry Jude. Can you get in touch with the podcaster and talk to him about it? Or remove yourself from the project?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Good suggestion, Dante. That’s definitely what I want to do, but I’m a little intimidated. This guy has a following that is growing by the day. I want to stop him from putting more content and messaging like this out there for listeners, but I’m worried about his influence and… you know I’m not very confrontational.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: I know, Jude. I get it. It can be scary to take a stand. But hey, I can do it then! That’s totally my style- it’s time to bring some heat! They don’t call me Dante’s inferno for nothing!</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Thanks Dante, but I don’t know… I need to think on this. Maybe I can write him a thoughtful email with some well-supported points and he will reconsider what he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: You know what? Wren will know what to do. Tracy will have great perspective too- but she has her kids so I’ll let her rest.</p>
<p>*Dante Facetimes Wren and she joins their call. Jude explains the situation to Wren and Dante offers their suggestion of butt-kicking*</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Hmm… let me investigate this. *Furious typing* So from what I’ve been able to find, his podcast stats show that his views are growing steadily, but they’re still menial compared to the big fish of the podcasting world. So that’s a positive thing… to slow them down even further I could hack into the cloud and delete all the content and resources in his personal drive!</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: …who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: The reason I’m nervous to say anything to him is because I don’t want to do anything that could cause more anger and backlash directed against the LGBTQ community. I know what he’s broadcasting is wrong and harmful, but I feel like it needs to be addressed in a way that wouldn’t inspire him to anger.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: This reminds me of the library in Toronto that allowed an anti-trans speaker to give a presentation in their space. The 2SLGBTQIA+ community responded by having a protest outside the library and had more trans and trans-allies there than there were audience members who came to see the author speak.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: That seems like a really effective and powerful way to combat harmful perspectives like this. What do you think, Jude? Could you organize something like that in response to the podcast site? *Furious typing quickens* I’m looking at the podcast website- if I redirect the viewers to advertisements, it just sends them to extreme-right wing funded organizations. Not a good approach. We’ll have to find another strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: I think some information should be censored on mass media platforms like podcasts. Hate speech has no intrinsic societal value and is undeserving of protection.</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: I agree Dante, but I have to wonder if counter speech is the better approach? Don’t you think the strongest ideals prevail? The minimal amount of regulation that exists in the podcasting world facilitates unfettered discourse and there are much better ideas out there that promote love over hate!</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: Well, Jude, I think existing imbalances of power and prejudices make it difficult for marginalized communities to confront harmful messaging on equal footing.</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: I agree Dante. Thanks for talking this through with me. And thank you both for all of your help. I feel like this situation is all my fault. You were right about those forums becoming feedback loops. I didn’t question or validate the information I was finding because it was so novel to me. I was looking for one thing and didn’t realize who I was surrounded with or being influenced by. I don’t know what to do… I am going to think about it some more, but I know it’s unethical of me to ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: We are glad you see that side of things now Jude, we’ll always try to steer you right. It’s good you’ve recognized those things and just know that we are here to help you in any way you need. Dante’s inferno is always ready to be unleashed, just say the word.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Yeah, the podcaster took advantage of how helpful and kind you are. It doesn’t sound like he was upfront about the nature of his show with you or you never would have supported it. Now Jude… what’s your laptop password? You are a good person, you’ll do the right thing, and I’m glad you called us. But… you don’t need to know what happens next. *Furious typing intensifies*</p>

<p>*Jude Facetimes Wren*</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Hey Wren, I just wanted to check in and see if there were any updates on last night. What did you end up doing, after all?</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Oh Jude, that is classified information. Need to know basis, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: Wren, I appreciate it, but it’s not something that will cause any backlash, will it? You can tell me; I won’t be upset.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: Oh Jude. I didn’t do anything wild. Also, you should probably stick to analog tech- the 1990’s called and want their website design back. Changing the SEO was super easy. There’s some technical stuff like with root directories and assigning it not to be indexed, but I also changed all the keywords into Klingon. No one will ever find it! Bwahaha! (ghuy’cha’ in Klingon)</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong>: You are a genius, Wren! I am forever indebted to you and hereby declare my undying servitude.</p>
<p><strong>Wren</strong>: I’m just glad to have my friend Jude back. Now get some sleep and we can discuss your debt of servitude later!</p>
