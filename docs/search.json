    "section": "From information scarcity to attention scarcity",
    "text": "From information scarcity to attention scarcity\nIf we think about a market system, what is within this system that contains value? That which is valuable to consumers. And, how is the value of something calculated? By demand. A product which is in high demand is generally more difficult to keep “on the shelves” or in-stock. If a product is highly sought-after, it becomes purchased; if purchased often enough, the product becomes scarce; if something becomes scarce (or rare), the purchasing cost is likely to go up. Rare items within a market system are expensive; commonly found items, or items in overabundance, are cheaper.  \nHow does this relate to an information economy? Certainly, information is not scarce in this context. As Simon (1971) states:\n\n“[I]n an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.”\n\nIn an information economy, in which we are an informatic personhood (Lee, 2021), our attention is the means by which we “pay” for information services. Our attention is paid through our time and energy spent investing in an information economy. For example, scrolling through TikTok videos for hours is a way you “spend” your attention in this economical context. Your attention is the rare, scarce item within the information economy; there is a limited amount of it to go around (i.e., split between work, sleeping, eating, showering, etc.). Due to this fact, competitors within the information economy will try different tactics to grab hold of your attention. Notifications or pop-ups are ways in which a competitor tries to “bid” for your attention. As soon as you divert away from one information context, such as TikTok, to another, such as Instagram, that information economy has successfully “purchased” your attention. Different social media platforms have invested in various ways to hold onto your attention once they have initially grabbed it; for example, Facebook now automatically plays videos on your News Feed, instead of you having to push “play” each time.  \nWatch the following video, “The Attention Economy: How They Addict Us,” here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nDo you think there is a way to “escape” the attention economy? Do you think, between the choices of opting out of the system entirely or figuring out how to reshape the current system, one is more realistic or desirable than the other? Why or why not?"

    "section": "Information wants to be free",
    "text": "Information wants to be free\nWhen Encyclopedia Britannica went online, its publisher decided to offer its content for free. “It’s the new business paradigm,” says an executive at the company, “information wants to be free”: \n\n“Basically we are a content company and we believe we should deliver in whatever form users need it. We made it free because we felt it was the only way to get the critical mass of people visiting the site that we need to make money from sponsorship and e-commerce.” (Fischer, 2008)\n\nWhen a user consumes information for free, the way in which a company makes money is from advertisements. However, users often do not enjoy being bombarded with advertisements when browsing an information resource. Advertisements may even deflect or deter a user from continuing to invest/spend their attention resources within a certain context. This may lead users to “purchase” the “free” (I.e., paying for a premium YouTube account with no advertisements, versus using YouTube for free with advertisements). What strategies can be used by companies to “sell” what is otherwise freely available?"

    "section": "How to “sell” the free",
    "text": "How to “sell” the free\nAccording to Kelly (2008), there are several strategies that we or a company can employ to “sell” free information in an attention economy:  \n\nImmediacy – getting the information you want, when you want it; having no need to wait around to access the freely available information (I.e., paying a bit extra to see a movie in theatres versus waiting for it to be freely accessible on a streaming media provider, like Kanopy or Hoopla provided by Halifax Public Libraries).  \nPersonalization – a personalized copy of an information resource, which motivates the user to pay for what would otherwise be free.\nInterpretation – providing a paid service (like technical assistance) for free software or instructional information (I.e., technical support provided by TELUS will charge you money to speak to a representative over the phone, whereas the same information online can be found for free). \nAuthenticity – paying for the “authentic” version of a software/information that is “tried and true” (I.e., paying for the authentic version of a Taylor Swift recording via a Spotify subscription versus downloading the song freely [illegally] at a potentially lower quality).\nAccessibility – paying for backups and storage of online information (i.e., iCloud).\n\n\n\nEmbodiment – paying for the experience of being in an information setting with other “users” (I.e., paying to see multiple bands perform at a music festival versus watching a recording of those performances online)  \nPatronage – paying a fee to support your favourite authors/artists/creators; those within a “fandom” will opt to support the creation of their favourite works, so long as it is easy to do so.\nFindability – information that is free may sometimes be more difficult and time-consuming to find.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nWhat strategies are/could be used by libraries to “sell” the free?"

In an attention economy, when everything is free, you are the product. By choosing to spend or allocate our attention to one resource over another, this is how we volunteer to be and exist within an attention economy platform. The ways in which we browse, search, stream, or select media become data that is generated about us, commodified, and sold. Companies use strategies for attention-grabbing, such as some of those we discussed in Section 8.4. Advertisers watch online habits to better provide more streamlined advertisements to best suit your attention-driven needs.\nWatch the following TEDTalk by Tristan Harris on “How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every day” here:"

    "text": "Privacy and consent\nOrganizations need our consent to collect data about us. How do they get us to consent? Through strategies of digital resignation (Draper & Turow, 2019). Digital resignation refers to the phenomenon in which individuals feel that attempts to control the amount and type of information collected about them digitally are futile. There is a discrepancy between people’s attitudes and behavior around privacy, namely, people say that privacy is important to them, but act in a way that is contrary to that belief (Kokolakis, 2017). This sense of futility has been cultivated, specifically in corporate spaces, to make individuals see “corporate power as an inevitable and immovable feature of contemporary life.” (Draper & Turow, 2019) \n\n\n\n\n\nAbove is an example of a company employing digital resignation. While the language suggests that this is an opportunity for the reader to make their own choice, the amount of text, language, and design contribute to making this overly complicated, prompting users to just click through quickly to get past the jargon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nWhat choices are being made in the above image that could result in digital resignation? How would you design an alternative to support authentic consent? \nEven though you are providing small amounts of information across different platforms, computers will generate extremely precise data about you by bringing the data all together.

    "text": "Trust in the machine?\nOver time, platforms can collect thousands of data points for a single user and compile this information into a kind of profile that can be used in recommendation algorithms that push content to users. The goal of platforms is to get users to remain online, viewing content (and ads) for as long as possible. Therefore, the recommendation algorithms are key in accurately predicting what a person might like to see, and therefore, keeping them engaged on the platform. TikTok, which is increasingly popular, specifically with young people, has employed an unprecedented centring of algorithmically driven feeds in the For You page (Bhandari & Bimo, 2022).\nWhile these algorithms do succeed in predicting the content a user would like to see, and keep them engaged on the platform, this can lead to untruthful and unreliable content being boosted, if the algorithm predicts that it has a large enough audience. AI has been shown to display a lack of fairness, and reinforce stereotypes of specific gender, racial, and cultural groups (Panch et al., 2019). In the United States, politicians have identified social media algorithms as a major contributor to the spread of misinformation that culminated in the January 6th insurrection (Morrison, 2021).\nWatch the following Crash Course video on “Algorithmic Bias and Fairness” here: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nIn what ways do you think it’s good to collect large amounts of information about people?"

Companies also collect data to improve customer experiences and address negative experiences. Without data collection, we would be unable to make decisions based on empirical information and would only be relying on opinions and preferences.

    "text": "Case study\nAn outbreak has sent countries across the globe into lockdown. Jude works at the Nova Scotia Archives, and they have directed their employees to work from home in accordance with provincial regulations. Jude initially finds a stable routine helpful; he wakes up in the morning, takes his dog Kevin on a walk, and then begins his workday. As the months go by, Jude finds himself consuming more and more online content instead of doing the things he regularly enjoys. Jude begins to immerse himself heavily in the perspectives of certain online forums and media. The gang grows concerned with Jude’s online behaviours and collectively check in with him in their group chat.\nInfo Masters: Group Chat\n3:07am\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: Hey friends, check out this YouTube video when you get a chance- really interesting perspective… not something you’ll hear on the mainstream media.\n9:45am\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Good morning Jude, et al. I see you were up really late Jude, were you just watching videos all night?\nDantes_infern0: Rise and shine team! Let’s manage information 😊\ntWrending_in_tech: Good morn!! Hmm… I saw this the other day when it was floating around the internet… but only cause I’ve got to keep my finger on the pulse of the web and not because it’s content I usually watch… where did you find this, Jude?\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: Haha, yeah, I was up pretty late. I just kinda fell down a rabbit hole in this online forum I’m a part of and next thing I knew it was 3am. Gotta stop doing that! Let me know what you think about the video.\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Oh dear- Jude, it sounds like nights like that have become the norm? That doesn’t seem like a very healthy lifestyle. Why are you up so late every night?\nDantes_infern0: From the activity logs I can view on the social sites we’re all a part of you seem pretty active on a few different pages and groups. Take a break, my Jude!\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: I don’t need a break. I’m just really curious and interested in learning about viewpoints I’ve never been exposed to. I’ve been finding so much new information from videos and articles shared in these groups.\ntWrending_in_tech: Awe, Jude- we’ve always loved your love of analog formats! So, this comes as a bit of a surprise. It seems like your attention has been captivated by these groups- just based on what I see you reposting and chatting about! (Please don’t be mad, just checking in- ily)\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Well said, Wren! I remember when I first got a few online platforms- I couldn’t tear myself away! There was always new and exciting information out there and everything always felt so urgent. I was afraid to log off and miss new content.\nDantes_infern0: Hahaha- when I first got Facebook, I remember joining so many groups dedicated to raising tropical fish. I got REALLY into it, but after a while, I realized the algorithm was designed to show me things I liked and interacted with. It kind of becomes a positive feedback loop. I’m still leaving fish groups, and that was 5 years ago. I also purchased a fair few fish tanks- dang targeted ads!\ntWrending_in_tech: Hilarious, because I’ve never seen you keep a plant alive for more than a week. Dante’s inferno indeed. Jude, as someone who works in tech, could I kindly suggest that you be careful about where you are investing your attention and time? Some online sites and apps are designed to capture and monetize your attention and aren’t necessarily concerned with the well-being of users… they’re more interested in generating traffic on their sites.\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: No one is forcing me to be active on these groups though… the algorithm is working because I’m genuinely interested in this stuff. It’s free, too! The users are the ones creating all the content. I appreciate your concern, but I think I just get really into stuff, like the time I got back into baking sourdough bread at the start of the outbreak LOL.\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Thanks for that perspective, Wren! It is so easy to feel like we are in control because we are the ones clicking, but many online business models are designed to keep us on their sites. Our attention is a resource and should be protected and treated as such! Remember our Professor in Info in Society in first year telling us “If it’s free, you are the product”? It seems like the information you are finding is a valuable asset here but in reality, the data we provide is more valuable to these companies than the information we obtain from them… at least monetarily. And I understand that, Jude. You are someone who is wholeheartedly invested in what you care about, and that is such a wonderful characteristic of yours! But often our strengths and weaknesses go hand in hand- there is no harm in baking bread, but the viewpoints and content you are consuming so much of can potentially be a bit dangerous, in insidious ways.\nDantes_infern0: I saw a documentary about this recently! These sites are gathering and selling our data. They want users on their sites as long as possible to offer up more of their personal information. They track user behaviours so that they have more generated data to sell. It’s a cycle. Some people get in the habit of consuming information non-stop and don’t realize what they are offering in exchange for it.\ntWrending_in_tech: Agreed! That’s why I cap my screen time now and only go on my social sites intentionally and with premeditated purpose. Otherwise, I just scroll endlessly!\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: I’m surprised by your reactions. I just shared a video I thought was interesting and didn’t mean to cause an entire discourse on the commodification of our attention… talk about diverting attention away from the main point.\ntWrending_in_tech: We just want to make sure you are okay, Jude! With so much information and online content being created non-stop, the only limiting factor is really our attention. I have learned to be more mindful since working in tech. As someone with the inside scoop when it comes to algorithms, they have the potential to create and reinforce stereotypes, biases, and oppression. It’s our social responsibility to be cognizant of that fact and question what we are consuming and why. That’s just one techie’s opinion!\nIn_perpe_jude_ity87: Well, thanks for your concern, folks. I’ll take your advice and log off- I’ve got to get back to work. The fonds won’t fawn over themselves, haha. Ttyl!\nTrace_2_face_consultation: Thanks for the morning chat, all! Glad we got to check in with you, Jude!\nDantes_infern0: Yeah- this convo has made me consider public libraries’ roles in protecting patrons’ privacy and not revealing what resources are used and by whom. I’m going to go see what books we carry on these topics.\ntWrending_in_tech: And I’ll get back to my big evil tech company! Bahaha &gt;:) jk. Have a lovely day all!\nChat ended.\nConsider the themes discussed in the group chat. The gang observes that Jude’s attention has been monopolized by online groups sharing distinct points of view. They raise concerns over Jude’s level of awareness regarding the commodification of user attention and urge him to be mindful of this fact as he navigates online landscapes."

Fields such as Business, Finance, Management, Political Science, and others will categorize and define organizations as they relate to those fields. These fields of study may seek to analyze the hierarchies, structures, or success of different kinds of organizations. There are many theoretical frameworks as to how organizations function and flourish. Still, we will focus on frameworks that discuss how organizations interact with information to meet their goals.\nThere are a variety of types of organizations, which may have different needs and structures, including:\n\nGovernment\nNGOs (Non-Government organizations, generally non-profits or charities)\nCorporations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nHow do these organizations differ?

    "section": "The Learning Organization",
    "text": "The Learning Organization\nBusiness Management scholar Peter Senge developed the idea of the learning organization. He envisioned organizations that excelled in the face of rapid change through adaptability and informed decision-making. He wrote that learning organizations are “…organizations where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning to see the whole together” (Senge, 2006).\nSenge’s concept was influenced heavily by systems theory. Systems theory is an interdisciplinary term exploring how groups, systems, or individuals may interact in a larger system. Broadly speaking, it can be described as how things can be greater than the sum of their parts. Senge explored his concept of learning organizations in relation to the systems theory of organizations – which seeks to describe and explain how the organization works as a whole to accomplish its goals. Senge wrote a framework of core principles for the learning organization, including the concept he called team learning. Senge describes team learning as a skill in which individuals within the organization can discuss and have a dialogue with each other for the organization to learn and advance.\nIf you want to know more about the systems theory of organizations, consider watching this YouTube video (not mandatory, only if you are curious or confused): Systems Theory of Organizations."

    "section": "The Knowing Organization",
    "text": "The Knowing Organization\nWe can think of organizations from an information-based view in which the people in organizations are working with information to accomplish specific outcomes. Information Management scholar Chun Wei Choo created a framework in which these outcomes can be divided into three categories: sense-making, knowledge creation and decision-making.\n\nSense-making\nSense-making is a process through which an organization creates its identity and a shared context for action and reflection by collecting and interpreting data from its environment (Choo, 2006). Sense-making is s three-steps process that begins when an Ecological change in the organizational environment results in a disturbance that the organization needs to make sense of:\n\nEnactment. Organizations interact with their environment by selectively bracketing, highlighting or isolating data or by adding features to the environment to facilitate data acquisition and sense-making. After enactment, the organization has data to interpret.\nSelection. Organizations select plausible interpretations that best fit with past understandings.\nRetention. The products of successful enactment and selection are retained for future use. “It is like a historical document, stored perhaps as stories, explanations, and beliefs or as a map of relationships between events and actions. In these forms, interpretations are remembered and made available for future cycles of enactment and selection.” (Choo, 2006, p. 6)\n\n\n\nKnowledge Creation\nOrganizations must continuously create knowledge. Knowledge can be created by managing the relationship between explicit and tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is embodied knowledge that is hard to formalize or communicate to others (Choo, 2005). Explicit knowledge is the opposite; it is formal knowledge that can easily be transmitted between both individuals and groups, such as recipes, formulas, or instructions.\nChoo (2006) describes four processes through which new tacit and explicit knowledge is created:\n\nSocialization. “process of acquiring tacit knowledge through sharing experiences. Tacit knowledge is transferred from an experienced person to another person by the two working side by side, sharing the same work and social setting.” (Choo, 2006, p. 8)\nExternalization. “process of converting tacit knowledge into explicit concepts through the use of abstractions, metaphors, analogies, or models.” (Choo, 2006, p. 9)\nCombination. “process of creating explicit knowledge by finding and bringing together explicit knowledge from a number of sources.” (Choo, 2006, p. 9)\nInternalization. “process of embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge, internalizing the experiences gained through the other modes of knowledge creation into individuals’ tacit knowledge bases in the form of shared mental models or work practices.” (Choo, 2006, p. 9)\n\n\n\nDecision Making\nWhen making decisions, organizations operate under the principle of bounded rationality and are constrained by cognitive capabilities, available knowledge, and values. To help individuals in the organization make decisions, the organizations establishes value premises and factual premises. Value premises determine the desirable traits of an alternative, and factual premises determine what information is relevant to help the decision-making process (Choo, 2005). Then the organization performs a search for satisfactory alternative decisions.\n\n\nThe Organizational Knowing Cycle\nChoo (2006) describes an organization’s flow from one “mode” to another as the Organizational Knowing Cycle.\n“In the knowing cycle, a continuous flow of information is maintained between sense-making, knowledge-creating, and decision making, so that the outcome of information use in one mode provides the elaborated context and the expanded resources for information use in the other modes.” (Wei Choo, 2001)\n\n\n\n\n\nChoo comments that learning organizations will encourage and foster innovation through this cycle. Innovations and new concepts are created and evaluated based on the organization’s needs and goals. Concepts created are then tested and re-evaluated before being enacted in other organizational levels to generate new knowledge creation cycles.\n\n\nBusiness Process Models\nAs we consider ways organizations can learn and know, we can look at different tools to help sense-making, knowledge creation, and decision-making. One such tool is the Business Process Model.\nBusiness Process Models (BPMs) are tools that people within the organization can use to visualize the flow of different processes. These tools can also help us visualize the organization’s and individuals’ information needs at each step of the process. As different individuals and departments in an organization may come together to complete a task, so will the information needed to complete that task. By creating accurate BPMs, organizations can help create transparency for workers, allowing information needs to be better identified and met.\nBPMs will be discussed more in your Information Systems class, but we can develop a surface understanding of their usefulness in organizations. Each BPM will have a start point (where the process begins) and an end point (where the process is complete) and may describe different steps for each individual involved. The steps for different individuals may be visually represented in different “lanes,” like in the below BPM for a restaurant process. The customer, host/hostess, waitstaff, chefs, and even the point of sales system are displayed in their lane. Each lane outlines steps of how and when an individual will participate in the entire process.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: (Somphanpae & Boonsiri, 2016)\nBy examining each step of the process, we can anticipate what decisions individuals will have to make during their steps and seek to ensure they have the information they need. By ensuring that individuals are equipped with the information they need to complete their steps, we can help to ensure that the organization can carry out the desired process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\nAt what point in Choo’s model could a BPM be helpful for the organization – sense-making, knowledge creation, or decision-making?"

    "section": "Embedded Librarianship",
    "text": "Embedded Librarianship\nPeople tend to identify librarians based on the buildings they work in, thinking that “a librarian works in a library”. This is not always the case. As traditional reference services are becoming less common due to the rise of the internet and the changing role of libraries, librarians are moving out of physical libraries. Embedded librarianship occurs when librarians are embedded within organizations and institutions. These librarians develop strong relationships with the groups of people they work with, such as faculty, students, a marketing department or a research team. Embedded librarians are knowledgeable about the work their team is working on (Shumaker, 2012b). “In order for librarians to be effective in the learning community, they must be viewed by all as a partner in the community. Real familiarity with the course and content is vital to change the perception of students that the librarian is ‘just visiting’ and is not an integral part of the learning community” (Muir & Heller-Ross, 2010, p. 92)\nThree main factors define embedded librarianship: ongoing relationships, knowledge of and commitment to shared goals, and customized high-value contributions (Shumaker, 2012b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Embedded Librarianship\nEmbedded librarians can anticipate their patrons’ needs; they don’t wait to be asked for help. They work for an entire team and help multiple people at once. Embedded librarians understand the needs of their team because they are so familiar with the project. “With embedded librarianship, transactions still occur- documents are requested, instructional sessions are held, or documents are added to a shared virtual workspace- but the emphasis shifts from the transaction to the project” (Shumaker, 2012a, p. 13). Embedded librarianships are responsible for more than just providing a service.\n\n\nOther Kinds of Mobile Librarianship\nIt is not only embedded librarians that move outside of traditional library spaces. You may find a few different kinds of librarians outside the library. (Shumaker, 2012a)\n\nVirtual librarians. Virtual librarians are available remotely (sometimes 24/7 due to time zones) through phone, email, instant messaging or texting. These librarians are similar to traditional librarians in that they passively wait to be asked for help.\nRoving librarian. A librarian who sets up in different locations such as the classroom or cafeteria. This librarian differs from embedded as they are still disconnected from the organization’s work but are there to answer questions.\nPersonal librarian. First-year undergraduate students are each assigned their own personal librarian to go to for research help throughout their degree. This doesn’t work well with how many group projects are assigned in universities today, as each student would have a different librarian.\nConsulting librarian. Consulting librarians work with either a team or an individual client. They establish long-term relationships and are always planning for the next project. The only drawback is that they aren’t always considered part of the team."

    "text": "Case study\nWren and Tracey are out for a walk at Point Pleasant on a sunny Saturday morning in October. Last spring, the gang graduated from the MI program and have not seen each other since. The two are vecited to catch up and learn how everything has been going for the last few months.\nWren: Tracy! It feels like forever since I’ve seen you; it’s so good to catch up finally!\nTracy: It does feel like it’s been ages, but time really does fly. Hey! Have you heard what Jude and Dante have been up to this summer?\nWren: Yes- I grabbed dinner with them two weeks ago when they visited Halifax. Dante got an entry-level position at South Shore Public Libraries and moved to Lunenburg. Jude has been working as a digital archivist at a professional organization in Quebec City.\nTracy: That’s awesome; they got just the jobs they sought. How have you been?\nWren: I’ve been so busy! I was offered a full-time position with the tech start-up that I did my practicum at starting right after we graduated, and it’s been going well. At my firm, we develop solutions for businesses to collect and analyze data from their environment to monitor their performance and inform decisions. Our software has modules designed for different teams at various levels of the organization. The Information Management program prepared me for this because I’m part of the bridge team that works with clients to understand their needs and the software development team. What about you?\nTracy: I have been doing consultant work. It can be pretty intense, though; we move from one housefire to another. We primarily work with small businesses, especially NGOs or non-profits. But their infrastructure can be…messy. It is good, challenging work. I feel like I’m contributing to something good at the end of the day, you know?\nWren: It sounds like this job has the potential to be quite satisfying and fulfilling for you!\nWhile walking and talking, Wren receives a notification on her phone. Opening her email, she finds out that a large corporate organization has bought out the small company she works for.\nWren: Oh, wow. That was an email from my boss to everyone in the office. A large organization has just acquired our company! Good grief!\nTracy: That will be a big change. I dealt with a similar situation at a job I had in my late twenties. A corporation bought out the company I was working for, and everyone was apprehensive about how the transition would go.\nWren: Were people okay with the changes that came about?\nTracy: It was a big challenge at first. It took some time, but eventually, we ended up better off. I’m still connected with some of my old coworkers on LinkedIn, and they’ve told me how happy they are with how the company culture has developed. In my past work, I’ve also helped organizations determine their information needs and implement processes that address and meet them. But I agree with you – change is uncomfortable. Plenty of people at both companies will feel uncertain about the effects of the change. Do you know this new company?\nWren: I looked at jobs with them when I graduated, but they’re too big for me. I didn’t want to go full on corporate – no offence. I wanted someplace small where I could learn and see the impact of my work. Now, being absorbed by a corporate organization… I worry that it may get too bureaucratic and inhibit our efficiency.\nTracy: Yeah, no offence taken – I get it. And I totally agree about small businesses – you learn a lot about how they work. Trust me, they will want you to be a part of this, especially since you understand the culture of your workplace. You can help new employees understand what is essential to your team and make this work. What does communication look like in your current workplace?\nWren: Since we’re a small team, communication essentially happens in person, by email, and mostly on our shared whiteboard. It’s all a very fast-paced environment with changes happening quickly. No one is really in charge; it’s mostly a collaborative team.\nTracy: Ah, I see. You guys do software… so the environment needs to be quite agile?\nWren: Exactly! We move fast, minimize formal communication, and basically just get stuff done! Now, we’ll have many new external stakeholders to answer to, potentially delaying our ability to execute quickly. Our company used to decide on its own internal objectives, and now we will be tasked with answering to larger-scale goals and external determinants of value. Before, we were happy to place user-centred design at the forefront of our company goals and our small successes were based on integrating customer feedback, but now, at a corporate level, I’m not sure what benchmarks of success we will have to meet.\nTracy: Yeah….so change management is going to be critical here. There are going to be some conflicts in work culture and communication methods. I hope they have someone that’s done this before.\nWren: Well, I know the company quite well; I’m not sure a larger company seeking to incorporate automated knowledge management software appreciates the human perspective I bring.\nTracy: I can understand why you might feel this way; it doesn’t feel great to have to constantly defend the importance of your role and the value you add to the information processes of your organization.\nWren: Yes, exactly, Tracy. In a smaller workplace environment, it was clear how employees contributed to the work they did and to what degree. Now, I might be tasked with writing multiple reports a year outlining how my position is critical to the company’s success.\nTracy: I’m sorry, Wren. If it makes you feel better, your friendship is invaluable to the gang and me. You are a fantastic communicator, though, so I think as long as you exercise those skills during this transition period, everything will work out okay. Growing pains!\nConsider the exchange of information and knowledge in the workplaces you have worked in and the professional environments you have been a part of. Reflect on the importance of communication and how it impacts the success of an organization’s goals.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhat should Wren’s company do to ensure a smooth transition with the merger? How can they ensure that the information flow stays efficient?\nConsider your current or past places of work- how does information flow internally? How does it flow externally?\nDo you find communicating easier in smaller team environments than in larger ones? How do communication processes change based on the size of the group? How are our environments influenced based on information processes?\nThink about how these organizations fit into society in a larger context; what role do they play in facilitating communication and information flow on a societal level?\nConsider the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom pyramid. Does it seem relevant to the organizations you have worked in? How could you reimagine it based on the flow of information and knowledge exchange in the organizations you have been a part of?\nDo you think there is a difference in how non-profit or government-funded organizations share knowledge internally compared with for-profit?"

    "text": "The datafication of the human experience\nLee (2021) uses the term Informatic personhood to represent the human experience in a world dominated by information technologies. The informatic person lives within the informatic context which is the technological, economic and social networks. The informatic person experiences and influences the informatic context through data interfaces, data circulation, and data abstraction.\nData interfaces “are those systems, devices, infrastructures and objects that connect (individuals or collectives) to broader assemblages of data” (Lee, 2021, p. 173). Your smartphone, smartwatch, tablet, television, computer, and the specific sites or apps that you use (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, TikTok) are all data interfaces through which we humans experience the world. Data interfaces are also extractive, as other entities on the network use them to extract data from or about you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nThe examples above are all digital platforms or technologies. However, not all data that exists is in a digital form. Can you think of other kinds of data interfaces that are not digital?\n\n\nData circulation refers to the dynamics of data mobility (and immobility), how data is created, moved, stored, shared and repurposed. Humans (but also other entities like machines, companies, and governments) circulate data, and almost everything we do can be understood as a form of data circulation.\nData abstraction describes how machines or humans use data manipulation techniques and produce some outcome (intended or not) (Lee, 2021). It is essentially the raison d’être of data interfaces and data circulation. Here’s an example: Through our smartphone (interface), Google Maps collects data about the current traffic conditions (data circulation) and updates directions to make routes quicker and more efficient.\nLiving in the informatic context are informatic persons who navigate their existence through and with data (Lee, 2021). Our informatic personhood is not separated from our physical, biological selves. People develop physical injuries from texting on their smartphones, typing on keyboards, or looking at screens. The informatic context also changes our brains, as humans develop neuro-physical mechanisms to handle things such as information overload and the data interfaces that constantly seek your attention. The informatic context can actually change our attention spans and ability to concentrate (Lee, 2021)."

    "text": "Networks, standards and marginality\nNetworks are all around us (e.g., phones, computers, road systems, the post), and many of these networks become stabilized and standardized over time. We can think of these networks as the informatic contexts within which we live our informatic personhood. We access the networks through data interfaces and then circulate data on the networks, which generates some outcomes. This section is about the standardizing forces of networks that constrain how we can access them and the things we can do on them. Indeed, every network is characterized by a more or less stable set of norms and standards, some of which can be extremely difficult to change once the network is stabilized. For example, the colour red for stoplights was an arbitrary choice initially but has become so universal that it is no longer a choice.\nNetworks are also not neutral. They are populated with actors or groups that have more influence or power than others and can thus influence the structure of the networks, how they operate, and what their norms and standards come to be. Those who happen to fit the standards can navigate the network with some ease, but others who do not fit the standards can find themselves marginalized and excluded. Since there is always a gap between the standards of social or technological networks and the needs of the individuals that live inside (or outside) of them, we can think of the marginalization of actors on the network as a continuum: everyone is marginalized to some degree. Susan Leigh Star (1990) discusses the problem of standardization through an analogy. They are allergic to onions and observed that their order for a burger with no onions at McDonalds would take a very long time to prepare. They realized that because the standard process of preparing a burger at McDonald’s includes onions, going against this standard “breaks the system”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggesting reading\n\n\n\nThis short post about life without a smartphone illustrates some of the points Star (1990) made long before smartphones even existed:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/04/my-life-without-a-smartphone-is-getting-harder-and-harder"

We now turn our attention to the social relationship that these networks enable by connecting us to one another. Webster (2014) invites us to think of three ways in which humans are connected to one another. Door-to-door connectivity occurs when people live, work and play in one place. Their connections are with their immediate neighbours. Place-to-place connectivity is when people are connected through travelling and gathering together in a network of places. Person-to-person connectivity is placeless and consists of relationships mediated through information technologies. This is what Webster (2014) calls Networked individualization: the use of technologies to develop and maintain social networks that provide sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging and social identity to the individual. These networks allow people to escape the social network in which they are physically situated (where they may be exposed to diverse values and beliefs that may differ from their own) to join other social networks composed of networked individuals with shared values and beliefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nThink of different communities or social networks that you belong to.\n\nAre they door-to-door networks, place-to-place networks, person-to-person networks, or a combination of these?\nCan you identify significant differences in the values and beliefs that characterize those networks?\nWebster (2014) argues that people have a compulsion to proximity, an impulse to meet up with people face to face regardless of their virtual relationships. Do you think the COVID-19 pandemic might have changed that somehow?\n\n\n\nIn the following TED talk, Sherry Turkle offers a critical perspective on our relationship with technologies and our growing abandonment of the here and now to participate in virtual networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of the arguments made by Turkle in their TED talk?\nHow do you use social media to connect with different communities?"

Tracy and Jude spent the summer working in the city, while Dante and Wren have just returned from a month of travelling. They went on a road trip around Nova Scotia, exploring seaside towns and enjoying many beach days. You have been keeping up with frequent social media updates on their accounts: ’Throw_a_Wren-ch_in_it” and “All_you’ve_ever_Dante-d” where they post updates and pictures of their adventures. You notice that Jude and Tracy’s online activity and social media content differ from Wren and Dante’s. You consider your own information networks and how you exist as an informatic person.\n\nYou: Good to see you, Dante, Wren! Wow, you both look like summer has treated you well!\nWren: Hey, strangers! You wouldn’t believe this past month- pure bliss. Once I graduate, I’m living on the beach full time; try and stop me!\nDante: Says the person who complained about the Atlantic Ocean being too cold the entire month of August.\nWren: At least I’m not so afraid of sharks. I won’t even go in the water past my ankles. Say, do you follow that great white shark tracker online? Everyone is tweeting about their geographic locations around Nova Scotia beaches and panicking. I feel like they get a bad rap.\nTracy: Oh yes, I do follow that! I feel like it’s an excellent way to see a global network of such an amazing creature. I think widespread panic regarding something like sharks is unavoidable in a large online setting like Twitter… besides, don’t you think social media and being online distorts how we view anything?\n\nDante: What do you mean?\nTracy: Well, I guess we can all be interpreted differently online depending on how we exist and interact in our networks. Take your accounts, for example. You and Wren aren’t a part of the beach brigade all year round, you know? All Wren has been posting about lately is lobster rolls and lifeguards she finds dreamy. If you didn’t personally know her, would you be surprised to learn she is working towards a career in data management?!\nWren: But… that is me! I’m behind the screen posting those things! Are you saying I’m not as adventurous and fun in person as I look online? Also, data is fun!\nTracy: I think you are even more so, friend! But we all curate ourselves and engage differently online, right? Like, I don’t share pics of my kid, for example. That’s just too personal for me.\nJude: I agree with Tracy. I have a co-worker who posts his original poetry on his social media. It comes across as totally innocent; at work, he is such a nice guy! We found out the other day that he has been writing about the new interns and sending his poems to them on their personal social media accounts! Let’s just say he’s getting reviewed this week…\n\nDante: Well, I wrote and posted many a song on my guitar as Wren, and I gallivanted across our glorious province this summer, and all of them were simply odes to my love of Mother Nature. No harm in that!\nWren: Not all true! Remember when you wrote that cheesy song for your boyfriend’s birthday and accidentally posted it on your public social media?!\nDante: Oh, right! Only my mom ended up watching it before I took it down, but I wouldn’t mind if others listened. I express myself more freely online.\nJude: I’ve got to hear this song! I do, too, Dante. I feel more comfortable sharing my views on various social justice issues on my blog than discussing my opinions in class. I feel more confident online, almost like I can be a different person behind the screen. I also feel like I have more tools and information to connect my thoughts and make more informed arguments!\nWren: You are so tactful and thoughtful about your online activism, though, Jude, unlike that one politician who blasts people on Twitter all the time. That has really been detrimental to his professional life.\nDante: Yeah, like that dude I know who got fired because of the insensitive things he posted on his Facebook.\nTracy: That’s precisely what I’m afraid of! I’ve had some platforms for so long that, at this point, I have a huge mix of professional colleagues, friends, and family involved in my networks, so I have to engage very thoughtfully online. I enjoy connecting my various worlds and communities and wish I felt freer to share different types of content, but my content seems increasingly restrained. I’m down to recipes now, for the most part.\nWren: Well, I still stand by the fact that Wren, in real life, is the same person who has reviewed 30 different versions of lobster rolls with a side of lifeguards. I think that’s a rather impressive data collection, considering I was on vacation…\nYou realize you have been scrolling through your phone for 10 minutes, considering how you engage online. You are connected with Dante, Wren, Jude, and Tracy on social media and other online networks (e.g. online learning software, social platforms, professional development sites, digital correspondence).\nYou continue contemplating the topics that have come up in your conversation. Consider how you exist in your information networks, in a mobile society, and your informatic personhood.\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nIn what ways might Wren’s online persona be authentic? In what ways might it be curated?  \nHow do you feel about workplaces punishing people for the content on their social media channels?\nDo you think it’s okay for companies to look at personal social media accounts in the hiring process?\nDo you believe companies have the right to monitor the activities of their employees in a personal setting? Would you consider social media and online platforms a private or public environment?\nWhat are 3-4 online communities you are a part of (school, family, friends, work, etc.)? Consider how you establish and situate yourself in your networks.\nWhat information do you share online? Does this change based on the online space you are in?\nConsider 1-2 ways technology facilitates or inhibits your ability to interact in your in-person and online networks. How do you act as a bridge between various worlds?\nConsider the differences (or similarities) in how you interact with friends, professional colleagues, or other groups online versus in person. How do you engage with them differently online than you do face-to-face? Do you feel you take on a different persona? What benefits or detriments do you perceive as a result of this difference?"

    "text": "A definition of information for the information field?\nWhatever name the schools or programs that train information professionals are called (e.g., Information Management, Information Studies, Information Science), most have in common that one word: “information”. It is thus no surprise that at least a handful of scholars working in these schools or departments have sought to provide some conceptual clarity regarding that word that unites us all. What may be more surprising, however, is that several decades of scholarship and debates have not achieved consensus on the definition of the word information. Still, these conceptual explorations have generated many attempts at such a definition, leading us to explore a range of other correlated concepts that have sometimes been used to determine what is (and what is not) information. They have also generated entertaining debates, such as the well-known discussion between Birger Hjørland and Marcia Bates on whether understanding information as an objective phenomenon is helpful for the field. In the next section, we provide an overview of how three scholars of the information disciplines have proposed that we should think about the term information: Marcia Bates, Birger Hjørland, and Michael Buckland.\n\nBates: Fundamental forms of information\nMarcia Bates believed that all information is natural and exists in the material world of matter and energy and that “almost anything existing in the universe that can come into human and other animals’ purview can be experienced as information” (Bates, 2006, p. 1033). From there, she constructed a glossary of the different forms of information:\n\nEmbedded information: Information left behind on earth by animals. Includes such things as human-created tools or paths through the woods.\nEmbodied information: The corporeal expression or manifestation of information previously in encoded form.\nEncoded information: Natural information organized symbolically, linguistically, or signal-based.\nEnacted information: The pattern of organization of actions of an animal in, and interacting with, its environment, utilizing capabilities and experience from its neural stores.\nExperienced information: The pattern of organization of subjective experience, the feeling of being in life, of an animal.\nExosomatic information: Information that is stored outside of the body.\nExpressed information: The pattern of organization of communicatory scents, calls, gestures, and ultimately, the human spoken language used to communicate among species members and between species.\nGenetic information: Information contained in the genotype\nGenotype: The genetic constitution of a living thing.\nInformation 1: The pattern of organization of matter and energy\nInformation 2: Some pattern of organization of matter and energy to which a living being has given meaning.\nKnowledge: Information that has been integrated with other contents of understanding and, therefore, given meaning.\nNeural-cultural information: Information created by, processed in, or disseminated from animal nervous systems, especially human nervous systems. (Neural information may also be used for lower animals and/or specifically for the nervous system structures that make memory and action possible in general in animals and humans.)\nPhenotype: The genetically and environmentally determined embodiment of a genotype.\nRecorded information: Information that has been stored in a durable medium.\nRepresented information: Natural information that is encoded or embodied.\nTrace information: The information that remains after a species is done with it. For example, a no-longer-used wasps’ nest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to read more about the fundamental forms of information and their relevance for the information field, according to Marcia Bates, you can read the full article:\nBates, Marcia J. 2006. “Fundamental Forms of Information.” Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 57 (8): 10331045. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20369.\n\n\n\n\nHjørland: Information as a subjective/situation construct?\nAccording to Hjørland (2007), there are two basic views of information:\n\nObjective information: any difference (in patterns of matter and energy, as in Bates’ concept of information 1).\nSubjective/situational information: a difference that makes a difference.\n\nIn his paper, @hjorland_information_2007 criticizes Bates’ fundamental form of information and argues that only subjective information is relevant to the field. While Bates’ concept of information 2 is compatible with that view, the concept of information 1 is not and should be ignored. Hjørland also argues that Bates’ definition of information 2 is too limited because it specifies the need for a living being to interpret the signal and give it meaning, which excludes the idea of computers processing information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nDo you agree with Hjørland and think computers can give meaning to the signal they process?\n\n\n\nFor Hjørland, If no one is aware of an object, then it cannot be information; it can become information once someone (or a computer) becomes aware of it. Under the situational definition of information, whether or not something is information depends on the circumstances surrounding the document, data, object or event. These things may be defined as information in certain situations but not others. This idea becomes complicated when you think of how vast the range of information can be; determining if and how something can be informative is very difficult. A tree can be informative in multiple ways. It will represent other trees of its kind, but the rings inside the trunk also provide information about weather patterns. Anything can then be information given the proper context. Hence, for Hjørland, there is no point in ever considering information as an objective phenomenon without any context since information is determined and defined by that context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested readings\n\n\n\nIf you want to read more about Hjørland’s view of information and his argument against Bates’ information 1 concept, you can read the full article:\nHjørland, Birger. 2007. “Information: Objective or Subjective/Situational?” Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 58 (10): 1448–56. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20620.\nThis article was followed by a response from Bates, followed by another response from Hjørland if you are curious to see how this little dispute unfolded.\nBates, M. J. (2008). Hjørland’s critique of Bates’ work on defining information. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59(5), 842–844. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20796\nHjørland, B. (2009). The controversy over the concept of “information”: A rejoinder to Professor Bates. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60(3), 643–643. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20972\n\n\n\n\nBuckland: information as thing, process, and knowledge\nBuckland (1991) describes information in three ways; information-as-thing, information-as-process, and information-as-knowledge.\nInformation can be considered a thing when it describes an object, such as data or documents. They are considered information because they are informative; they impart knowledge or communicate information. Everything around you can be informative, which is problematic for information professionals. Indeed, the information systems we manage deal directly with information-as-thing and since we cannot deal with everything in the world, we need to decide what kinds of information-as-thing we choose to engage with. The term document may be helpful here. According to Briet (1951), a document is “any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, reconstruct, or demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon”. She is well known for her example of an antelope as a document. She discusses how an antelope living free in Africa would not be considered a document, but once captured and put into a zoo, it becomes an object of study. At that point, it has become a document as it is now physical evidence to be used by researchers. Information as a process occurs when someone is informed of something, changing what they know, and what is known is information-as-knowledge that exists in an intangible form in the mind of the knowing entity and cannot be observed or measured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nOne branch of our field is called knowledge management. If knowledge is information in an intangible form that cannot be observed or measured, how can it be managed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nTo read more about Buckland’s concepts of information-as-thing, information-as-process, and information-as-knowledge, you can read the full article if you haven’t already:\nBuckland, M. K. (1991). Information as thing. Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 42(5), 351–360. https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199106)42:5%3C351::AID-ASI5%3E3.0.CO;2-3"

    "text": "The data, information, knowledge, and wisdom pyramid\nIn exploring the concept of information, we came across many other terms, such as document, knowledge, understanding, and data. One way to try to make sense of it is by situating each of these terms in relation to each other. The data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy or pyramid (pictured below) was not developed by scholars in the LIS field. Still, it can be helpful to us as it offers a visual representation of the relationship between some of the terms we encountered so far.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) pyramid\n\n\nMany authors agree that the first appearance of the hierarchy was in T.S. Elliot’s poem The Rock.\n\n“Where is the wisdom that we have lost in knowledge?\nWhere is the knowledge that we have lost in information?”\n\nThe hierarchy connects wisdom, knowledge, information, and data to identify how entities at the higher levels are created from those at lower levels. According to the pyramid, data generates information, information generates knowledge, and knowledge generates wisdom. However, just as defining information has proven quite challenging, there is no consensus on the definition of each level of the pyramid, no consensus regarding the number of layers the pyramid should have, and no consensus regarding the hierarchical nature of the relationship between the concepts. (Rowley, 2007).\nRowley (2007) reviewed the literature on the pyramid and how each concept was defined. She found that most definitions of data point to it being discrete objects, facts or observations, or recorded descriptions of things, events, activities, or transactions. According to Rowley’s review, researchers describe information as data formatted, processed, used, or given meaning. Knowledge is often defined as information processed in an individual’s mind and may also include the requirement that this process has generated justified and true beliefs about the world (Rowley, 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\n\nIf, according to the pyramid, information is processed data, and knowledge is processed information, then how would you define wisdom?\nDoes good data necessarily lead to good information?\nIn what ways do information professionals deal with each level of the pyramid?\nWhat levels of the pyramids can be achieved by computers?"

There are two primary forms of democracy: one in which the people participate in policy and decision-making directly through their vote (direct democracy) or indirectly by electing representatives who exercise political power on their behalf (representative democracy). Most democracies today are representative democracies. According to Webster (2014), four essential elements must be in place for a democracy to exist: regular elections and re-elections, a plurality of political parties, a secret ballot, and the universal right to vote. Then, additional factors can be considered to determine whether a democracy is strong or weak. In other words, we can think of some democratic ideal that can only be imperfectly implemented in society, and we may seek at any point in time to question how near or far we are from that ideal and what can be done to bring us closer to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of some factors that can make a democracy stronger or weaker?\n\n\nIn your reflection, you may have identified many factors related to information, which is perhaps not a surprise given that democracy is one of the core values of the information field that we discussed in the first chapter of this book. If you look more closely and think about it, you will likely realize that pretty much all of the field’s values relate to or support, in some way, the democratic ideal. Let us dive into it a little bit.\nFirst, the value of rationality is strongly connected to the democratic ideal, which is not simply about people deciding but about the ability of the deciding people to use reason or logic to inform their decisions. For this ideal of rationality to be attained, people must be informed to consider all relevant facts and ideas (including views opposing their own). This highlights the importance of another core value of the field, intellectual freedom, which is about the rights of people to hold, share and access ideas without restrictions. Indeed, it isn’t easy to imagine individual voters as perfectly rational agents if they cannot access all the required information or share it with others. Even if, hypothetically, all the relevant data or information would be made available and thus, in theory, accessible, it does not necessarily mean that everyone in practice can access and process it. This is where another value of the information field comes in: literacy. Information literacy, data literacy, and all the other literacies we care about in the field are ways to empower individuals to find, evaluate, process, and use information to improve their lives, fully participate in society, and embody the democratic ideal as rational agents. Finally, while it may not be directly linked to the values of the field, participation is a crucial element of a properly functioning democracy since having perfectly rational and well-informed agents serves little purpose if only a handful of them take the time to exercise their right to vote. Suppose we interpret the concept of participation more broadly as being engaged in political discussions (i.e., taking part in the production and consumption of information). In that case, we can say how a lack of it may also hinder access to information and undermine our potential for rationality. Moreover, unbalanced participation, where only some voices are heard, can also hurt the quality of democratically made decisions. This brings another of the field’s values into play: equity, diversity and inclusion in the access and production of information and the representation of the information (this is the focus of the next chapter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nPlease think of the past chapters in which we discussed the information economy, the attention economy, and misinformation, and consider how those relate to the democratic ideal and the factors we identified necessary to achieve it."

    "text": "The public sphere\nThe concept of the public sphere, which was developed by Jürgen Habermas (1999), can be defined as:\n\n[A]n arena, independent of government while also enjoying autonomy from sectional economic forces, which is dedicated to rational debate (i.e., to debate and discussion which is not ‘interested’, ‘disguised’ or ‘manipulated’) and which is both accessible to entry and open to inspection by the citizenry. It is here, in this public sphere, that public opinion is formed. (Webster, 2014)\n\nThe public sphere is not just a single place or a time; it’s a concept that encompasses both physical and digital spaces, and it is a combination of all those spaces where conversations, ideas and minds meet. The public sphere is also constantly evolving, and its development is greatly affected by technological advances and our increased reliance on digital modes of information exchange (McKee, 2004).\nIn the short video below, Fred Turner discusses the emergence of a digital utopia that envisions digital technologies as enabling a world of free democratic choices and heightened consciousness that is diverse and free of sexism and racism.\n\n\n\nFred Turner : l’utopie numérique from Culture mobile on Vimeo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of the vision that Turner describes? Do you also think that this vision may be revived? What would need to happen for this to happen?\n\n\nMcKee (2004) discusses five issues with the public sphere.\n\nIt is too trivialized; people care more about unimportant news like celebrities’ lives than real-world events.\nIt is too commercialized: the media wants to make money, and, in the process, quality suffers.\nIt’s a spectacle: the public looks for eye-catching visuals and superficial distractions over meaningful conversations about serious issues.\nIt’s too fragmented: national culture falls to the wayside while niche identity groups become more common. People are less interested in the same general information.\nIt has made citizens apathetic to critical public issues: people care less about the important political issues of their country.\n\nThere are many obstacles to participation in the public sphere. Many of the obstacles found in the real world also translate directly to online communities. The Internet was meant to make politics more inclusive, allowing more people to voice their opinions. It was meant to allow for equal participation. Instead, the Internet reinforces many of the problems seen in the offline world (Albrecht, 2006)."

    "text": "The public library and the public sphere\nWiddersheim (2016) describes the public sphere as a three-layered social phenomenon, including infrastructure (the physical space), people (who exist within the space) and communication (between the people). When looking at the public sphere through this framework, public libraries are part of the public sphere. Libraries were created under the pretense that information belongs to everyone and should be available to everyone. They provide equal access to information for everyone at no cost so that people may be well-informed and able to participate in public debates (Audunson et al., 2019). They are publicly funded by taxation, but their operations are still separate from political interests (Webster, 2014). Public libraries also help to encourage democracy by providing a space for people to gather and debate. Friends, neighbours, and strangers gather in the public library, generating social capital. Communities with higher social capital tend to have higher civic participation. On top of providing space, libraries also provide the materials people need to learn and be informed of the issues (Appleton & Hall, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nHow do you think you, in your future career as an information professional, can work to limit the obstacles to participation for the community you serve?\nHow do you balance intellectual freedom with advocacy and activism?"

We interact with our friends, family, neighbours, community members, and more on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nConsider the prerequisites for the democratic ideal. How do they pertain to social media platforms?\n\n\nConsider the following excerpt from York & Zuckerman (2019):\n\nWhile the real-name policy shifts the balance of power from users to platform owners, increasing the costs for bad behaviour, it may be accompanied by another effect: a growing reluctance on the part of users to produce content. Facebook routinely prompts users to post content, recycling past posts as memories ready for reposting and assembling albums commemorating friendships between two users so they have something new to post. Scholar Trebor Scholz points out that platforms like Facebook rely on their users to create content—without user-created content, the sites would have nothing to offer (Scholz 2012). This insight has yet to turn into the workers’ rights movement Scholz and others have hoped for. While concerns are sometimes raised that the growth of platforms like Facebook is slowing, user-generated content sites are the most popular and influential sites on the Internet.\nAccording to analytics company Alexa, six of the top ten websites in the United States, in terms of traffic, are built on user-generated content—YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, Reddit, eBay, and Twitter—and two others, Google and Yahoo!, are arguably built on indexing user-generated content. At this point, user-generated content sites are not the exception to the rule but the dominant social web model. The beauty of this model for the platforms is that users do almost all of the work. The platform is responsible only for providing a space where a user can publish while the user creates the content. The platform succeeds fiscally if it can make more from advertising on user content than it spends creating and maintaining the space. (York & Zuckerman, 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nDo sites relying on user-generated content reflect the democratic ideal? Why or why not?"

    "text": "Algorithms, automation, and echo-chambers\nWhile human users generate most of the content on social media platforms, that content is not necessarily user-curated. Instead, most social media platforms use algorithms to curate content. While the exact programming of many algorithms is shrouded in secrecy, curation can be determined by what the user has selected to view before, who they follow on social media, or other information gathered from the user. While this can create a tailored experience, it can also create echo chambers, where users will see and share content similar to what they already enjoy and endorse instead of being exposed to diverse information. For example, consider the author and law expert Frank Pasquale’s writings on the automation of the public sphere:\n\nThe basic contours of mass media-driven politics and culture remained stable throughout the second half of the twentieth century. But since the mid-1990s, the public sphere has endured yet another structural transformation. Megafirms like Facebook and Google have largely automated the decisions once made by managers and programmers at television networks or editors at newspapers. Automated recommendations are often helpful, aiding audiences as they seek to sort out the blooming, buzzing confusion of topics online. But they are also destabilizing traditional media institutions and circuits of knowledge. (Pasquale, 2018)\n\nPasquale also writes about how the anonymity offered by the Internet can influence the public sphere:\n\nWhile secrecy has empowered some voices who would otherwise be afraid to speak up, it has also protected trolls, doxers, and other bad actors online who silence others’ speech via intimidation. Moreover, online anonymity is of piece with financial anonymity, which has empowered thousands of shell companies to obscure who is funding messages that could sway the public, legislators, and regulators. Everyone is invited to participate, but so too is “everyone” capable of disrupting other communities of interest online via hashtag spamming or trolling—whether by civil society groups, state actors, or miscreants pursuing disruption “for the lulz.” (Pasquale, 2018)"

    "text": "Activism and social media\nAs political discourse occurs on social media websites, many political movements or other activist causes find a foothold online. Sociologist and writer Zeynep Tufekci speaks to the challenges and successes of social movements online:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n York & Zuckerman (2019) give the following example of how social media can be successful at initiating social change:\n\nSocial media has emerged as a battleground for human rights defenders because of its value in mobilizing resistance movements and in publicizing otherwise invisible points of view. The 2011 uprisings in the Arab world and beyond demonstrated the mobilizing power of UGC platforms, while their aftermath—from the emergence of new democratic norms in some places to war in others—exhibited UGC platforms’ value in the documentation of human rights abuses. In late 2010, a Facebook page emerged in Egypt entitled “We Are All Khaled Said” (in English and in Arabic). Set up to memorialize Khaled Said, a young man killed by police in Alexandria, the page was then used to promote an already-organized set of protests, following in the footsteps of the Tunisian protests that had just effectively deposed the country’s autocratic leader of twenty-three years, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The page’s call to protest went viral among Egyptians, many of whom had previously only used Facebook for ordinary activities and communications, and on January 25, 2011, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest. The initial effectiveness of the Egyptian uprising, which deposed long-term autocrat Hosni Mubarak, inspired movements throughout the Arab region and well beyond. Some of those movements, such as that which took hold in Syria in February 2011, sparked violent clashes, leading to civil war. In the case of Syria, social media has been effective both in documenting and sharing human rights abuses, as well as in the dissemination of propaganda. Such content is not immune from the impact of content moderation; Facebook and YouTube have both been accused of contributing to the erasure of evidence from Syria. (York & Zuckerman, 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and reflect\n\n\n\nHave you seen movements of social change originate or propagate in your social media platform of choice or elsewhere online?"

It’s been a while since they graduated, and their conversation centers on changes in the public sphere and how they understand their evolving roles in Information Management.\nDante: How have you all been? It always feels like too much time passes between these video chats. I wish we all still lived in Halifax, but it’s great to have us all together now. We missed you in these calls, Jude!\nJude: Hey all, I missed you too. It’s nice to see your faces and hear your voices. I want all the updates!\nWren: Well, I’ll go first because I’m sure you’re all dying to hear about the fabulous lifestyle of Wren Reilly. I’ve been good! I am so busy working at the tech company and volunteering in my spare time, but I am happy. Halifax misses you, Dante!\nTracy: That is wonderful to hear, Wren. I love seeing your updates on Instagram. I’ve also been inordinately busy! My daughter Ava just started grade ten and is enrolled in one too many extracurriculars. And she’s struggling with speaking French here in Montreal.\nDante: That’s a hard age; I wouldn’t want to return to being fifteen. I know you’ve told us Ava is a big Taylor Swift fan! I was scrolling through YouTube in bed last night and watched her speech after she was presented with an honorary doctorate in fine arts at NYU.\nWren: I watched that, too! My roommate is a huge Swiftie, so I’m always in tune with what’s happening with her. She had me watch her documentary as well.\nJude: I also watched it- she’s a very eloquent speaker.\nDante: What did you think of her speech? I found it interesting when she talked about the issues she has dealt with being in the public sphere, how incredibly hard it was almost to be cancelled online back in 2016. It made me think about your situation with the podcast, Jude.\nWren: Some parallels there! In her documentary, Taylor talks about finding it difficult to express herself or her political views due to the fear of being cancelled or polarizing her fans. It must be hard to be famous and constantly worry about what you say, do, or post online for fear of backlash.\nTracy: It’s not just famous people who worry about those things. The public sphere isn’t safe for a lot of people. I haven’t told you guys yet, but recently, Ava decided to come out on Instagram. She posted a photo of herself and her girlfriend with a caption about their relationship. She thought she was ready, but people are being awful online. She has strangers and classmates writing hateful comments and sending her mean DMs on her posts.\nJude: You are right. When dealing with that podcast situation, I worried about creating more backlash against the LGBTQ+ community. Still, I couldn’t continue enabling the spread of hateful messages, so I said I couldn’t participate in the show anymore. I’m disappointed to hear that Ava’s classmates aren’t being supportive, Tracy. I’m glad she has a mom like you!\nDante: Oh Tracy! I am so sorry to hear that; Ava is such a sweet girl and doesn’t deserve to deal with that. I feel like social media creates so many issues. Strangers shouldn’t be able to make people feel so bad. It’s so easy for people to say things online that they wouldn’t say in person.\nWren: Yes, I hope things get better for Ava soon! This makes me think of the debate that some of my colleagues and I have discussed about whether social media improves society. When it was first created, I feel like the idea was that it would create a platform where everyone’s opinions could be heard and the democratic value of free speech would thrive. But clearly, this isn’t entirely true.\nTracy: Oh, it’s not true; social media has become diluted with misinformation and created polarization between different groups. Different communities only see similar opinions to their thanks to the algorithms that run these sites, which creates a positive feedback loop, reinforcing people’s biases. Look at what happened to Jude… it is so easy to find yourself down a rabbit hole surrounded by viewpoints that are cleverly disguised or drown out any sensible ways of being. He was sucked into helping to distribute the same nonsense, and that’s not the Jude we know! Thankfully, he found his way back to his ethics and values with help from his friends.\nWren: *Grinning widely* and a little of Wren’s magic.\nJude: You’re so right, Tracy; it greatly worries me. I often think about what I can do as an information professional to help change this. Maybe ways that I can educate people about these issues.\nTracy: I often feel that way too, Jude. I honestly have been feeling so helpless with Ava’s situation. I want her to be safe and happy; right now, she isn’t feeling either. I don’t think she realized the sort of bigger political sphere she was stepping into by coming out so publicly. I hope that it doesn’t affect her in any way in the future.\nWren: We are here for you and Ava, Tracy. Please reach out anytime, even if you need to talk. This can’t be easy for you as her mother.\nJude: I agree! We love you, Tracy.\nDante: Hear! Hear!\nTracy: Thanks, everyone! You know how to help me feel better. I appreciate the chat and looking forward to catching up again soon!"

    "text": "What is the information field?\nThe Master of Information, like other similar programs offered in Canada and the United States, is often associated with libraries and librarianship (and rightfully so) because of its accreditation by the American Library Association (ALA). ALA-accredited degrees are generally a requirement for a range of positions in libraries of all kinds and other related organizations. Accordingly, most students reading this chapter will likely be interested in pursuing a career in librarianship. Many of you, however, are in this program with completely different careers in mind, and you may be surprised by the emphasis on libraries. Perhaps some of you have no prior thoughts about the program or the field as you are taking this course as an elective or simply because you ended up here randomly. Those of you in the Master of Information Management program, which is not ALA-accredited, are likely mid-career professionals working in a wide range of sectors. Whatever group you find yourself in, now that you are here, you might be surprised by the breadth of the discipline and the many professional pathways it can lead you on. Maybe you joined the program to be a children services librarian and will come out of it as an aspiring data scientist…who knows?\nSo, what is the information field? Bates (2015) referred to our discipline as a meta-discipline that spans the entire spectrum of traditional research disciplines, from the Arts and Humanities to Natural Sciences. While it is not comprehensive, this figure from Bates (2015) was an attempt to illustrate the breadth of the discipline by situating many of the sub-disciplines across that spectrum.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1.

    "text": "Roles, values and principles\nThe information professions fulfill a wide range of societal and organizational roles. All organizations produce and need information to support their operation. They support the day-to-day activities of organizations by collecting and organizing data, documents, and archives and by managing information systems, among other tasks. Information professionals also have an educational role, which they often fulfill by providing data, information literacy, and information technology training to patrons in public libraries, students, and colleagues in any work environment and by gathering and organizing teaching materials to support educators. Information professionals also play an essential role in supporting research in academic, governmental, non-profit, and corporate settings. Information professionals can also play a key role in fulfilling the culture and entertainment mission of organizations such as public libraries and museums.\n\n“Because of differences in goals and in the basic principles that underlie the various disciplines represented in the information profession, it is difficult, if not impossible, to express a single set of values across the information professions.” (Koehler, 2003, p. 109)\n\nDespite the diversity of roles and settings in which information professionals operate, there is a core set of shared values within the field, which tend to be promoted by the programs and professional associations. The following are examples of core values in the information profession, adapted from Gorman (2015). These values may reflect the historical focus of the field (and of Gorman’s book) on libraries. Still, they are also broad principles that can be relevant and applied in various professional settings.\n\nStewardship\nGathering, organizing, and preserving information for future use.\nService\nBeing of service to our users, colleagues, and communities.\nIntellectual freedom\nProtecting the right of people to hold, share and access ideas without restrictions.\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion\nEnsuring that all individuals and groups have access to information, can participate in the production of information, and be adequately represented in information.\nPrivacy\nprotecting the privacy of individuals and activities.\nLiteracy and learning\nPromoting reading and lifelong learning.\nDemocracy\nSupporting democracy and democratic principles.\nSocial responsibility\nWorking to make the world a better place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to think about\n\n\n\nThink about some of the type of work and organization that interests you as a future information professional.\n\nCan you think of ways in which the roles, values and principles listed would apply to that setting?\nAre there roles or values that are not relevant in this context?\nAre there other values or roles that you can mobilize as an information expert in this context?"

    "text": "Public libraries\nSome job duties you might encounter while working in a public library include programming, organizing the collection, building community partnerships, answering information requests, providing information literacy training, preparing library budgets and conducting needs analyses.\nSome skills that may be necessary should you wish to work in public librarianship include supervisory experience, computer literacy, competency with intranet content management and document management using software, ability to work well with the public, project management and knowledge of the trends in library service design (MLIS skills at work). Of course, these skills are not all required, and you can learn some on the job, but you should look to take courses and internships that help to improve these skills.\nMany professional associations to check out if you are interested in public libraries, such as the Public Library Association (a division of the American Library Association) and the Nova Scotia Library Association (free membership for students).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professionals\n\n\n\nDyan Bader\nManager\nSystems & Collections Access Nova Scotia Provincial Library\nAs the manager of systems and collections access for the Nova Scotia Provincial Library, Dyan works with all the public libraries outside Halifax, which are grouped into eight regional libraries. Her team manages the back-end systems these libraries use daily, including the integrated library system, their discovery layer, and their digital lending platform. Each regional library region made their own decisions related to the integrated library system. Still, during the last five years, Dyan and her team worked with the eight regional libraries to integrate these into a single system called “Same Page.” The new system launched in April 2022 expands access to almost 1,000,000 resources for patrons throughout Nova Scotia. With the new system, Dyan’s team must work with the different regions to ensure consensus on all decisions that impact the system. These large projects require a lot of planning and coordination to ensure that the best decisions are made since they directly affect libraries across the province. Most of Dyan’s time is spent in meetings and writing documents.\nThe Nova Scotia Provincial Library is part of the provincial government and supports regional libraries in several ways, either as a leader, a partner, or a service provider. This brings a lot of variety to Dyan’s work since her projects and tasks are driven by these different roles.\nSpecific skills would benefit those looking to work in a similar role. Project management is huge, as well as problem-solving, facilitation and time management. Leadership is something that you will learn along the way.\nOne piece of advice that Dyan would give to students is to focus on what they are passionate about. For her, it was an interest in technology and cataloging. Try your best to stick to those things, and hopefully, you will end up in positions that allow you to explore these passions. Dyan was lucky to have employers who supported her training goals, allowing her to complete an advanced certificate in digital services and a Master’s certificate in project management.\nSome of your first jobs can shape your career. She also suggests being open to jobs in less urban areas as you can often gain skills in these positions that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in a more extensive library. When you enter a larger or more structured environment, your job description can often hem you in, and the position won’t have the flexibility that allows you to evolve quickly. Dyan’s first job after graduation was as a director of a small community college library in Southern California. Upon starting, she soon realized that she would need to completely replace the integrated library system and re-catalogue the entire library. Running this massive project gave her the experience she needed to move forward in her career and to understand her own abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nJeff Mercer\nDeputy Chief Librarian\nSouth Shore Public Libraries\n\nAs the deputy chief librarian of a small system of libraries, Jeff is responsible for many different things. He is in charge of PR, promotions, community outreach, and volunteer services. He oversees all programming at each branch, IT, and systems support or development. Jeff also oversees policy and procedure review and revision and has some input on collections development. In terms of staffing, Jeff deals with hiring, performance evaluation, goal setting, training, and occasionally scheduling.\nThis position has two main sides: the public side and the staff side. Jeff’s job is to say yes as much as possible to patron’s requests when working with the public. Jeff must also help his staff to be successful in their positions.\nTo work in a similar role, one must have time management and people skills. In this position, there are a lot of competing demands on your time, such as meetings, staff support, research and workshops. People skills can be gained through working with the public in different service roles, such as restaurants or retail stores. It’s essential to recognize that people have different communication styles and may not interpret what you say in the way you mean.\nWhile you are still in school, taking advantage of student opportunities, such as joining professional organizations, is essential. Make sure to take any opportunity to learn from working professionals. Jeff mentioned that specific courses within an MI degree would be helpful for this job. Community-led services was one of them, as responding appropriately to your community’s needs is essential. He also mentioned courses on readers’ advisory since the collection goes hand in hand with services. A library’s collection needs to reflect the broader trends in society. You want a fresh, young collection that is responsive to people’s needs.\nThe best advice Jeff would give is to go to any conferences, workshops or other professional development opportunities you can. It’s not just about what you will learn but also about who you will meet and what they can teach you. Along the way, you will gain insight that will be useful in your future career. He also suggests that you shouldn’t say no to any opportunities. His first job gave him the skills he needed to obtain his current job. He also believes it’s important to listen if your gut tells you that your current direction isn’t right for you; you shouldn’t stay in a job you don’t enjoy because you can always change direction."

    "text": "Archives\nWorking in archives is a common path for people taking an MI or MIM degree. Archivists work in various organizations, including corporations, universities, and non-profits. Some roles they may take include archival specialist, creative arts archivist, archives project associate or archives and special collections librarian.\nWhile archives and libraries have many points in common, they have significant differences that often set them apart as clearly distinct fields. Archival records are very different than bibliographic records. They tend to be created and maintained for different purposes and guided by different principles and philosophies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nThe Master of Information program offers several archives courses and an archives certificate. There are also practicum and internship opportunities available for you to gain experience.\n\n\nSome job duties one may encounter working in archives include preserving and providing access to historical records, developing an archival digitization program, and promoting the use of collections to the public. To get more information about the archives field, you can check out the websites of the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Canadian Council of Archives, and the Council of Nova Scotia Archives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet a professional\n\n\n\nSharon Murray\nArchives Advisor\nCouncil of Nova Scotia Archives\nAlthough Sharon does not hold an MI degree, her job is very relevant to people within the program, and her knowledge of the profession is vast. Before working in her current position, Sharon worked directly in the archives, digitizing items for improved access. She systematically processed the photographic records at the archives she worked in and created databases to store them in. She was also required to label, re-shelve and store items. She created web exhibits and research guides for improved public access. Her path to archives was not a straight one. She initially picked up archives work as a side job to improve her research. After returning to Nova Scotia, she picked up more substantial work in the archives. She began to pivot as she felt that the archives were a very fulfilling fit for her skills, experiences and interests. She found it eye-opening to see how much impact archival records can have on the public when true, meaningful access is provided. While in this role, she digitized several thousand photographs. She and her colleagues had a lot of discussions about storage and access.\nSharon’s current role with the Council of Nova Scotia Archives differs significantly. The CNSA is the professional association for archives and archivists in Nova Scotia. The organization’s purpose is to provide support, education and advocacy for those in the profession. In Nova Scotia, there are around 75 archives that are members, which range vastly in size and resources from small volunteer-run archives to larger ones with multiple permanent paid staff. The CNSA offers courses, workshops and training opportunities to help members develop the essential knowledge and skills to manage their archives. Sharon teaches most courses, with 50% of her role offering advisory services. Due to this, she must keep on top of the current discussions and needs within the profession to ensure that the knowledge she is conveying is current.\nSharon describes the two most essential skills in the archives profession as a background in Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) and digital preservation and access knowledge. The profession is currently at a turning point in which they acknowledge their role in silencing the stories and voices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Archivists want to ensure that they are doing the right thing in the future by endeavouring to preserve records, stories and information about all people. The second turning point she described was the digital turn. Archives are heading into brave new territory where it isn’t paper-based records but digital content that must be preserved. A lot more digital-born content will require digital infrastructure to be built. It is also essential for archivists to have relational skills, meaning a desire to build relationships and connect communities. Archive work is becoming more service-oriented.\nThe best advice that Sharon would give to students is to build relationships with people working in the field, as it will help them to understand the realities of the profession. It will also help you understand what you have to offer and how your skills and strengths might be helpful to the community. She also suggests looking outside Halifax for summer work positions, as many of these small organizations seek help. You will get the opportunity to work on many aspects of the archive and likely learn a lot about community building."

Depending on the type of museum, these libraries and archives can be part of the collections or exist to support the museum’s activities. For example, a good exhibit might rely on having done research on the topic and its social or historical context or on specific items that are part of the exhibit. Then, you can think of museums as just another type of organization where librarians or archivists are needed.\nAnother critical role for information professionals in museums involves dealing with information systems and users. Museums increasingly have online collections and databases to support them. These require a set of competencies and skills, such as database management, organization of information, and user-centred web design, that you can develop during your MI degree.\nMore generally, the close relationship between the information and museum fields may be blurry enough that your information degree could help you compete for any museum role, especially if you have a background in the arts and humanities or another area that is relevant to a particular museum.\nTo better understand the jobs available in the museum space, check out the Canadian Museums Association (https://museums.ca/) and their job board."

There is a significant need for these positions because programmers created systems to store data, but more needs to be done to organize and manage that data. They have found that when using these systems, things aren’t accurate, and queries are not constantly pulling up the right data. There is also bias in the systems depending on who entered the data. Some systems have too much data as it hasn’t been managed, disposed of or cleaned in years, creating privacy issues. This is where data governance comes into play. It is Stephanie’s job to govern how the data is entered, how the data is utilized and how it is managed.\nStephanie provides service to clients. Her department serves all the department employees, helping them organize, collect, store, preserve, secure and dispose of information. She also must write policy instruments, including standards, guidelines, procedures, and processes for managing information. She must establish governance and facilitate decision-making with those with authority and responsibility regarding the data and information. As a manager, Stephanie manages the office, the employees, the workload, the scheduling of work, and the delegation of work. Open government is concerned with publishing information that would be in the public interest to be transparent. There is a lot of work to do in this regard, including ensuring that information is protected and publishing relevant information. To enhance democracy, all citizens should be able to participate in these discussions.\nIf you want to work in a similar position, you must be a people person. The job requires you to meet with clients, partners and collaborators and to work with people to help enhance their experience of working with information. This is a position in which you would rarely work alone. It would be best if you were organized and technologically savvy. This position is incredibly tech-focused, so knowing how information is managed through IT systems is essential. You must be adaptable as the role changes and open-minded to different cultures, languages, and personalities. You must also be bilingual, speaking both French and English.\nThe Federal Student Work Experience Program is a database for hiring students through the Government of Canada. Stephanie suggests you put your resume in as you may be hired for a government position. They offer full-time positions during the summer with flexible hours during the school year. They also can bridge students into permanent positions after they graduate.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/pay/rates-pay/student-employment-programs-federal-government/federal-student-work-experience-program.html\nThe best advice Stephanie would give is to be open-minded and willing to learn constantly.

During the final term of her program, she completed an internship with Rio Tinto Alcan in their International Intellectual Properties Division, and there, she learned that effective knowledge-gathering and sharing strategies rely on a sound understanding of your audiences. Knowledge Management work often involves doing research to fulfill specific needs and constantly re-evaluating knowledge purpose and use to ensure that the collected resources are of value for the people in the organization using them.\nTrecia is now the Community Services Librarian and Managing Branch Librarian of the Stellarton and Trenton Public Libraries and the regional Borrow-by-Mail service. In addition, her job portfolio covers the regional areas of responsibility for Public Relations and Communications, Programming, Outreach, and Services for Adults. One of her main focuses is developing Community-based programs and services, which involves working with the staff in each location to plan programming responsive to their communities’ needs. She finds that programming works best when there is engagement with the community to participate. Community-led programming begins with conversations with the community-at-large and other community service providers to determine programs and services of interest and value. This is the key to building responsive public library services.\nAccording to Trecia, some essential skills required of successful public librarians and public library staff include communication and leadership. Communication is critically important, mainly formal communication skills such as being comfortable with public speaking (giving presentations and leading workshops), understanding the evolving social media etiquette, and crafting effective media releases and grant applications (and reports). Management, leadership skills, and solid project management experience are vital to creating a healthy, responsive, thriving workplace environment.\nTo set yourself up for success in this field during your degree, Trecia suggests looking into how the interests of the faculty members in your program may align with yours. This can lead to research work opportunities. She also recommends considering how your background and experiences can be mobilized into your career in information - the strengths you can bring forward and how the information degree will complement these strengths. The information field is broad and offers many opportunities, so Trecia suggests that you try to take on projects that are meaningful and that you can connect to your interests."

    "section": "The informational justice framework",
    "text": "The informational justice framework\nKay Mathiesen (2015) defines a socially just society as one in which everyone is given equal opportunities and all groups are treated equally and fairly. She proposes an informational justice framework that includes three components:\n\niDistributive justice: To be treated justly as seekers, people should have equal access to information.\niParticipatory justice: To be treated justly as sources, all people should have an equal chance to contribute to information and knowledge. Everyone’s opinions and points of view should be considered, and everyone should have equal rights to contribute to decision-making about information resources.\niRecognitional justice: information should have fair representations of people and society.\n\n\n\nSource: (Mathiesen, 2015)\n\n\n\nLet us now consider these three components in a little more detail.\n\nDistribution\nIn her article, Mathiesen (2015) considers three distribution theories and their relevance to the information perspective. The first is the equal distribution of personal satisfaction, according to which pleasure, satisfaction, and happiness are the goods that need to be distributed equally between people. From this perspective, we should strive to provide information to people in a way that satisfies their needs and expectations. One issue is that people adjust their expectations based on their experiences and environments, so applying this model may reinforce inequalities by giving more to those who need more by having more and less to those who need less by having less. Another way to think of justice is to consider the equal distribution of resources, with information being the resource we would consider in the field. The problem with this approach is that two people with the same amount of information may not benefit from it. In a library where everyone has access to the same resources, some patrons may not be able to use these resources to the same extent as others. For example, a visually impaired person requires assistive devices to access the resources. Finally, the equal distribution of capabilities approach focuses on a person’s capabilities instead of their resources. These capabilities can be as simple as moving about, meeting one’s nutritional needs or acquiring clothing and shelter. So here, we might think of how the distribution of information provides everyone with the same level of capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndistributive Justice: A Real-World Example\n\n\n\nWhen Ontario locked down due to COVID-19 and sent all students home to attend school virtually, there was a massive disconnect between students with access to the internet and technologies. This was a clear case of a digital divide preventing certain parts of society from access to information. The Ontario government began an initiative to distribute 21,000 iPads and accessible data for school-aged children (ages 4-18). In this case, internet access, and in turn access to information, is considered a human right. Although this was a great initiative, there were downfalls, the main one being that with over two million students enrolled in Ontario schools, only 1% were provided with iPads. This is when 14% of Ontario households were deemed to have slow or no internet connectivity. One must question whether distributive justice was achieved (Smith, 2021).\n\n\nFor Mathiesen (2015), the field needs to focus on access, which she sees as a combination of resources (the information) and capabilities (to use the information).\n\n\n\nSource: Mathiesen (2015)\n\n\nThinking about access this way provides us with two main areas of intervention to make information more accessible: acting on the information itself or acting on the users or potential users. Here are five factors that can help to determine whether information is accessible to a particular group or person.\nAvailability: does the information exist?\nFindability: can the information be found?\nReachability: can the seekers get the information?\nComprehensibility: can the information be understood?\nUsability: is the information useful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nCan you consider other factors that information managers can consider to make information accessible?\nHow can we improve access to information by focusing on the users or potential users of information?\nHow can information be intellectually comprehensible but not physically comprehensible, and vice versa?\nHow can findability, availability and reachability issues affect unhoused and poor populations?\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipation\nThe participation element of Mathiesen’s informational justice framework is related to the concept of participatory justice, which “refers to the direct participation of those affected most by a particular decision, in the decision-making process itself: this could refer to decisions made in a court of law or by policymakers” (Wikipedia). In the realm of information, participatory justice thus refers to the equal opportunity for people to participate in producing and disseminating information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nIn the pre-digital world, the means of producing and disseminating information were concentrated by media organizations and governments. Now, the Internet and social media have levelled the playing field so that anyone can have a voice and participate equally in producing and disseminating information.\n\nWhat do you think of this statement? In what ways do you think it is accurate or not true?\nWhy do you think having equal access to producing and disseminating information matters?\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition\nThe recognition part of the informational justice framework emphasizes the importance of respecting identities and cultural differences. To help you think of recognitional justice from an information lens, consider how negative stereotypes about certain groups or cultures can be spread and reinforced in the news and social media through informational processes. You may also find helpful to replace the term recognition with representation and think of recognition justice as the right for all people to be fairly represented in the informational world. This idea celebrates the plurality of perspectives that are constructed through discourse and that are to be considered equal, as opposed to the idea of a single objective truth for us to know or the existence of “grand narratives” that represent the dominant perspective on the world and its history.\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada is a good example of an attempt to deconstruct a grand narrative about Canada’s history and establish a “new history” of the country that better represents the lived experiences and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nMathiesen (2015) emphasizes the interdependence of distributive, participatory, and recognitional justice.\n\nHow does distributive justice relate to participatory justice?\nHow does participatory justice relate to recognitional justice?\nHow does distributive justice relate to recognitional justice?\nHow do you think the three components of the framework come into play in the Truth and Reconciliation process?"

    "text": "Informational Justice in Museums\nMuseums are, traditionally, physical locations that serve a community by collecting, preserving, and presenting cultural heritage objects. However, museum institutions often come out of colonial contexts. When considering informational justice in the museum sector, those colonial pasts (and presents) must be examined and understood to pave the way for a future where the information and objects that museums manage exemplify justice, not bastions of inequality.\nThe collections of cultural heritage objects in many Canadian and international museums are made up of objects removed from their cultures and places of origin through dubious means or without consent. The provenance of these items is sometimes hotly debated, and many institutions are repatriating objects to their places/cultures of origin to reflect modern mandates that support informational justice and equality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the news\n\n\n\nhttps://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2022/11/risd-museum-returns-stolen-benin-bronze-sculpture-to-nigerian-national-collection\n\n\nAs information managers, we can also be critical of the information surrounding cultural heritage objects inside museum spaces. For example, many Canadian institutions displayed indigenous cultural heritage objects alongside information that suggested the cultures of origin were extinct when, in reality, many indigenous cultures are alive, resilient, and thriving in the present day. Many exhibits are curated to display certain cultures as foreign, and these exhibits are often curated without the input of people relevant to those objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nHow does this relate to Mathieson’s Informational Justice Framework?\n\n\nConsider the following quotation from writer, poet, and community organizer Jamara Wakefield:\n\nMuseums could be one of our greatest allies in liberation struggles. They have the physical space, the means, and the public confidence to partake in a large-scale social movement against colonial powers. Yet they reject this opportunity over and over again. They prefer to remain silent and hide in a world desperately needing decolonizing. (Wakefield, 2019)\n\nMike Murawski, author of Museums as Agents of Change, wrote the following on how colonial culture affects many aspects of museums:\n\nIt dictates how people hold meetings together, who is invited to those meetings, who participates, and whose ideas are valued. It dictates decision-making in museum spaces. It controls how we define “community,” how we work with community partners and what we value about those partners. White dominant culture dictates the words that get written on museum websites and on the panels and labels in the galleries, who gets to write, edit, and approve those words. (Murawski, 2021)\n\nMurawski (2021) wrote the following points on Identifying and Replacing White Dominant Culture In Museums:\n\nMove from professional and transactional relationships to relationships based on trust, care, and shared commitments.\nMove from protecting power to sharing power.\nMove from a culture of overworking to a culture of self-care and community care.\nMove from competition and struggle for limited resources to a mindset of collaboration and working to share resources.\nMove away from prioritizing only degrees, work experience, and job titles toward recognizing and centering lived experience.\nMove from a place of those with power making decisions for others toward a place where we work to include those affected by decisions in the decision-making process."

    "text": "Case study\nTracy, in Halifax for a conference, meets with Jude for a coffee to talk about Ava’s experience with bullying and online harassment. They discuss ways to address epistemic injustice and digital divides as Tracy contemplates moving their family to the States.\nTracy: Hey Jude, how have you been, old friend?\nJude: Hi Tracy! It’s so lovely to see you! It’s been a few weeks since we’ve been able to catch up. I’ve just been buried deep in the Archives, as usual. Honestly, that whole situation with the podcaster made me step back from my side projects so I could think deeply about everything. I might take a break from my blog for a bit. How about you- how are you and Ava doing?\nTracy: I’ve been good. I am very busy with Ava, as usual. My partner has been back in the Netherlands looking after his parents for the last few months, so there’s been a lot on my plate since I’m essentially acting as a single parent.\nJude: That sounds like a lot. How has Ava’s experience at school been since she and her girlfriend went public?\nTracy: Over the past few weeks, the buzz around the school has petered off, but they are still receiving hateful messages online. We’ve been having many conversations lately about boundaries with social media and ways they can manage their mental health. I tell Ava not to read the messages she receives, but I know they significantly impact her whether she reads them through or not. Delete and block, I say!\nJude: I am sorry to hear that. That is good advice- there is nothing to be gained by reading those messages.\nTracy: I agree. However, Ava has voiced that she wants to converse with them and present a different perspective. She is a lot like you in some ways, Jude. She wants to do good and provide people with information.\nJude: Well, she will be much better at it than I am. I think my days of social justice blogging are behind me. I feel terrible that I helped out that podcaster, and I think I need some time off. I’m sorry I made it possible for them to speak their message. I guess it’s more painful now that I’m realizing how it affected my friends and their families.\nTracy: Oh, but Jude, you didn’t know what he was putting out there- and your blog before was so well-received. It was educational, and I know it inspired its readers to take positive action! Think of all the great comments you used to get!\nJude: That is generous of you, Tracy. Over the past few weeks, I’ve thought that many of my readers also came from places of privilege, and I wasn’t reaching the people I wanted to reach. My readership- they have technology, they’re educated. Ava inspires me; how do you reach those who don’t have access to the same perspectives or resources? How do you introduce people to different ways of knowing and doing?\nTracy: That’s a good point, Jude. Epistemic injustice runs deep and is built into online structures just as it exists in the physical institutions and places we inhabit. It can be even harder to spot online because it is intangible, and the internet is so interconnected. Information is changed and influenced on all sides. Users are creators, authors, and audiences all at once. Ava’s school has a class on digital literacy where they discuss these themes. Their end-of-term project is coming up, and we have been talking about them quite a bit- especially in light of recent events!\nJude: Has Ava ever considered starting her podcast? It would be an excellent idea for her and her classmates to discuss these things openly and make them available for their peers and teachers to listen to. It might help engage them all in conversation on these topics, and as a new class begins each year, they could have multiple seasons!\nTracy: What a fascinating idea, Jude! See- we can’t keep you from trying to help others! While I think that has real potential, I am not sure Ava’s school has the technological infrastructure to support an initiative like that. The digital divide is quite poignant in our town- the schoolboard doesn’t have the resources to keep up with advancing technical change. Their school only got open Wi-Fi last year!\nJude: Hmm… well… now that my podcasting days are behind me, I’d like to redirect that effort somewhere that is needed. I have a ton of equipment in my studio, and I’d be happy to gift it to Ava’s school to get a project like this off the ground. I could even teach a few workshops on using the equipment and set them up with essential software to record episodes.\nTracy: I’m sure they would be happy to hear from you- why don’t I see if I can put you in touch? It’s great to have the old Jude back; this sounds more like him! Ok, Jude - stay out of trouble. Thanks for meeting me here at the hotel for a coffee. I’d better check on Ava and then wrap up the conference. We’re taking a red eye out of here tonight. I’ll see you in Canmore?\nJude: Good to see you, Tracy. Thanks for chatting. Yes, I’ll be in Canmore - I’m excited to get everyone together again!\nMany changes are on the horizon for each character, and with the fifth anniversary of their time at Dalhousie, they’ve decided to come together in Canmore, Alberta, for a celebratory trip. The four of them are out for a nice dinner on a patio overlooking the mountains, discussing their plans.\nDante: Thank you so much for planning this trip, Tracy! I’m so happy to have a relaxing vacation before my big move. I’m glad we chose a convenient location; the drive from Saskatoon wasn’t too bad.\nTracy: I’m so happy it worked out! It’s been a while since all four of us have been together, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. I’m glad we were all able to get vacation time set aside.\nJude: This was the perfect idea. The mountains are so gorgeous, and some outdoor therapy can never hurt.\nWren: So true! Tell us about your new job, Dante! We’re all so proud of you; this is such a big move for you.\nDante: Well, as you know, I’ll be working as the Chief Librarian at Iqaluit Centennial Library in Nunavut. My dream’s always been to run a library, so I’m super excited about this new chapter. There’s so much I want to do there, but the number one thing I want to accomplish is closing the digital divide. There are so many access issues in Northern Canada. I want to create programming to teach children about digital literacy and help them through issues they may be dealing with, like online bullying.\nWren: Dante, that is so lovely! That sounds like the perfect job for you. Tracy, how are things with your job?\nTracy: There have been some significant changes in my company. They’ve hired a Black female CEO recently, and so many positive changes have already occurred. I’m looking forward to seeing what new ways the company will work to promote equity. And you, Wren? You’re still at the same job.\nWren: I am! I’ve been there for about five years now, which seems crazy! Things are pretty steady at work, but a few months ago, I started a non-profit organization that helps to provide internships and mentorship for women in tech. I’m so excited to be able to help a new generation of women find their passion in this field. What about you, Jude? Is anything exciting happening at the archives?\nJude: That’s inspiring, Wren; you will make a difference for many young women. We just received a large grant from the government to work towards truth and reconciliation. I’m excited to work with the local Indigenous communities to find a way to improve the archives. On a similar note, I’m also consulting for Dante in establishing digital literacy programming. The podcasting initiative at Ava’s school was so successful and in demand from the students that the school was given a large grant by the province to set up more technical infrastructure. Donations from readers on my blog didn’t hurt either. We will draw from our experiences setting up that programming to address access issues in Iqaluit.\nDante: Looks like things are going well all around. It’s been a crazy few years, but I’m glad we all met! Cheers to many more years!\n[Glasses clink together in a sunlit shot with the mountains in the background in a Polaroid-perfect moment.]"

    "section": "The information society",
    "text": "The information society\nThe information society is a band from the 1980s, but it is also a type of society that succeeds the industrial society and in which information plays a dominant role. Theorists of the information society have focused on five dimensions of the information society (Webster, 2014):\nThe technological dimension of the information society is reflected in the growth of information technologies such as personal computers, smartphones, and the internet, which are now ubiquitous. The economic dimension of the information society emphasizes the dominance of information and knowledge industries and the increased share of countries’ GDP they generate. The rise of service industries demonstrates the occupational dimension and highlights that in information societies, most employees are not involved in producing tangible goods. The spatio-temporal dimension of the information society is centred around networks, digital technologies, and hyper-connectivity that transcend some of the time and space constraints of the physical world. Think, for example, of how information technologies allow you to engage with groups distributed around the globe or attend a live event in Australia or Norway no matter where you are. Think of how, in the middle of the night, you can virtually be somewhere where it is the middle of the day. The cultural dimension of the information society points to the role of information in the production and reproduction of culture and individual and collective identities. Finally, the theoretical knowledge dimension emphasizes the rise of evidence-based practice and the centrality of data, information and knowledge as the increasingly dominant drivers of individual and collective action.\nThese dimensions are not independent and are all intertwined, so it can be challenging to consider one without the others. Still, they allow us to consider our world and the kind of problems we are dealing with from different angles. This can help us achieve a more holistic perspective on information and its role in society and perhaps better solutions to the information problems we will tackle as information professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nDespite being a little bit dated and not written for an information science audience, the following book (which used to be the foundation of the course) can be a helpful resource if you are interested in getting an overview of the main theories of the information societies that have been proposed by scholars over the last 50 years or so.\nWebster, F.

    "section": "Types of information issues",
    "text": "Types of information issues\nIn the previous chapter and class, we explored the concept of information. We situated it in relation to dozens of related concepts, which I hope helped you expand your understanding of how information manifests itself in the different spheres of society. No matter where we look in this complex conceptual landscape, we can find opportunities and challenges for information professionals, or let’s call them “information issues” for us to tackle. I would argue that there are four fundamental forms of information issues:\n\nIssues of information access\nIssues of information quantity\nIssues of information quality\nIssues of information behaviour\n\nSome of these will come back in one way or another in the following chapters, so the goal is to provide a high-level overview and introduce some topics we will dive more deeply into later on.\n\nAccess issues\nArticle 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”. Also, Article 27.1 states that “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits”. These two points are closely tied to several of the core values of the field presented in Chapter 1, such as stewardship and intellectual freedom. The term participate in Article 27.1 can be related to access in terms of having access to the means of production and dissemination of information (e.g., computer, smartphone, internet).\nDespite being considered a universal human right, there are still many ways in which access to information is limited today. Some constraints can be physical when information is recorded on a non-digital medium and stored in a specific location, which may or may not be easily accessed, or when digital information resources are behind a paywall. Access to information is at the core of the mission of libraries that build collections of physical and digital information resources so the communities they serve can access them. This also applies to other settings in which information professionals work; there is often (if not always) an information user with more or less explicit and clearly defined information needs and an information professional whose role may be to ensure that the user has access to the information they need to fulfill those information needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nDo you think that all information should be accessible to everyone? If not, what kind of information do you think should not be accessible to all? How can you reconcile the notion that some information should not be accessible to all with the idea of information as a human right?\n\n\nAnother critical issue to consider is the inequalities in access to information. Since information is crucial for personal, social and professional development and for people to thrive in the information society, differences in access to information based on socio-demographic factors can contribute to creating or reinforcing existing inequalities. That is one of the reasons why equity, diversity, and inclusion are important topics in our field and why you hear about them in many of your courses.\nThe unequal access to information is often referred to as the digital divide, defined as “the gap between individuals, households, business and geographic areas at different socioeconomic levels with regard both to their opportunities to access information and communication technologies and to their use of the internet for a wide variety of activities” (OECD, 2001). You can check out the network readiness index (https://networkreadinessindex.org/) to see how countries are doing regarding digital infrastructures, connectivity and governance. Even within a single country, demographic factors can have a strong relationship with physical access to information and information technology. Income, age, gender, education and location are all predictors of whether people have internet access. And varying levels of information literacy may lead members of some social groups not to access information even when it is available (Sparks, 2013).\nAccess is also closely linked to the literacy concepts family (information literacy, data literacy, digital literacy, etc.), which is core to the information professions, especially in public and academic librarianship. That is where language and the ability to read and write come in, as one cannot access information if it is in a language they do not understand or if it is in a written format and they don’t know how to read. Similarly, people cannot participate in the information society if they don’t have the basic ability to communicate. Teaching people how to read, write and use information technologies is not typically understood as the role of information professionals. However, public libraries are often used as community centers where such training can occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nIn what ways do you think technologies help solve information access issues?\nIn what ways do you think technologies do not help, or even accentuate, information access issues?\nHow do you think information professionals can play a role in ensuring that technologies effectively increase access to information?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantity issues\nThere is a lot of information in the world, and a lot of new information is produced every day (that is, of course, if you subscribe to the notion of information as a thing. Otherwise, we could rephrase this and say that there is a lot of information happening every day). The following two quotes can help us grasp just how much information we are talking about.\n\nThe amount of information being created every two days is equivalent to that created from the dawn of civilization until the year 2003 (Benselin & Ragsdell, 2016).\n\n\n“A weekly edition of the New York Times contains more information than the average person was likely to come across in a lifetime in seventeenth-century England” (Bawden & Robinson, 2009).\n\nLiving in a world of information abundance, it may be difficult to imagine that we could still find ourselves in situations of information scarcity. Isn’t finding the information we need as simple as picking up our smartphones and “googling” whatever we want to know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of a situation in which you found yourself not finding (or having a lot of difficulty finding) the information that you needed? How did you feel? How did you cope with the situation? What was the outcome?\n\n\nYou may think that the general abundance of information is a good thing. After all, isn’t information the basis of all (or most) knowledge and better “informed” decisions? Can there be too much of a good thing as information?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you imagine a situation where you found yourself having too much information? What was the context? How did you feel? How did you cope with the situation? What was the outcome?\n\n\nThe idea that there is a point where more information is just too much information is often called information overload. This is by no means a new phenomenon, but as technological developments increase our capacity to produce, disseminate and store information, so does the amount of information that the average human is exposed to and needs (or believes they need) to process or manage. When the amount of information exceeds our capacity for processing and managing it, we are in a situation of information overload (Misra & Stokols, 2012). Information overload can cause many adverse outcomes, including psychological stress, exhaustion, negative affect, decreased productivity (Matthes et al., 2020), information addiction, distraction, and symptoms similar to attention deficit disorder (Bawden & Robinson, 2009).\nThe following video is about how having too much choice leads to poorer decisions or less satisfaction about our decisions, which the speaker calls the “paradox of choice”. I think it also applies to information and that we have, in fact, a “paradox of information”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality issues\nAccess to information is great, and access to a lot of information is even better (with some caveats, as discussed above). However, another fundamental concern with our information society is the quality of the information available to us. Again, if information is the basis of all (or most) knowledge and better “informed” decisions, what happens if the information we receive is inaccurate or simply false? We may reject that information by using our filtering mechanisms or critical thinking skills. In this case, the cost is some time for the filtering and selecting process. But what if we do not assess information, fail to recognize its poor quality and use it as a basis to form an important decision or to shape our worldview?\nThe widespread presence and spread of misinformation (and related concepts such as disinformation and fake news) has been facilitated by the rise of the internet and other information technologies that make the production and dissemination of information accessible to all. Bran et al. (2021) used the term Information pollution or ‘infollution’ to describe the growing problem of the spread of unwanted messages in society in quantity large enough to affect human and social activities significantly, and consider conspiracy theories, propaganda, memes and memetic warfare, and ideological manipulation as forms of infollution that can result in wasted time, physical and mental health issues and stress or addiction. No matter how one calls it or in what shape or form it presents itself, misinformation is one of the greatest challenges of our age.\nThere are other ways to think about information quality that come short of falling under the “misinformation” label. For example, we may consider that information is of poor quality when it is, for one reason or another, ineffective in achieving the desired goal (e.g., to inform, to increase knowledge, to make a decision). It may also be helpful to think about information not only in terms of a single information unit (e.g., a news article or a single statement in a text) but also in terms of collections of information units (e.g., a library collection, a set of resources used to support a decision).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of ways valid and accurate information may be ineffective at fulfilling an information need or supporting a decision or action?\n\n\nInformation issues can lead to Information anxiety, defined as the state “produced by the ever-widening gap between what we understand and think we should understand. It is the black hole between data and knowledge, and it happens when information doesn’t tell us what we want or need to know” (Naveed, 2020, p. 66). Its symptoms may include the inability to keep up with the information we are presented, frustration over the quality of information available, guilt about not being better informed, or the desire to be the first to know.\n\n\nBehaviour issues\nSo far, we have mainly discussed issues related to the information itself and its accessibility, quantity and quality. However, the last fundamental form of information relates not to the information itself and its characteristics but to how we use it or interact with it: our information behaviour.\nSuppose we side with Hjørland (2007) and consider that only the subjective/situational concept of information is helpful for information professionals. Then, we must conclude that all information phenomena that information professionals care about involve humans (or computers) that seek, evaluate, filter, store, organize, produce, disseminate, share, use, or react to information in their own way, depending on the context. In that case, the information world we live in (and all its issues of access, quantity, and quality) is the product of individual or group behaviour. However, our information behaviour has effects that transcend the informational world and can positively or negatively affect our individual and collective lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a positive impact on our lives or the lives of others?\nCan you think of three examples of information behaviour that can have a negative impact on our lives or the lives of others?\n\n\nThe notion of intent is important to consider when thinking about information and the outcomes of our information behaviour. For example, a corporation may intentionally reduce access to information by creating a paywall around highly valuable information. We may produce and disseminate a lot (quantity) of free content (access) with catchy titles but a low informative value (quality) to attract readers (behaviour) and generate ad revenues (intent). A social media user may intentionally post information (true or false) about someone else to hurt them. We may intentionally or unintentionally produce or share misinformation. Finally, we may intend to fulfill an information need by gathering a lot of information resources. Still, we end up causing information overload, analysis paralysis, or anxiety for ourselves or our users or clients."

    "text": "Case study\nOver the next nine weeks, we will follow four classmates and friends as they navigate graduate school and work in the information field. These characters will deal with many scenarios in which information affects their daily lives, giving you a chance to offer classmates advice and consider how you might deal with similar situations.\n\nThe characters\nWren Reilly (she/her) is a 28-year-old from Collingwood, a small town in Ontario. Wren is an aspiring data manager hoping to work in a position that allows her to work independently and utilize her organizational skills. Wren hopes that her undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Toronto will lend itself well to her future career in data management. She is logical, individualistic, and introverted and works well under pressure. Wren worked for a couple of small new businesses throughout her 20s, helping with programming, and worked in tech support for a larger organization. She plans to work with an organization one day where she can use the knowledge she will gain of databases to deal with big data.\nDante de Luca (he/they) is a 24-year-old aspiring public librarian from Calgary, Alberta. Dante has an undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Calgary. They considered a career in social work before realizing that public librarianship would allow them to combine their love of helping others with their desire to engage with the community. Dante has always had a passion for libraries. They grew up going to their local library every Saturday with their mom. Throughout high school, they volunteered as a reading buddy for younger children. During their undergraduate degree, they volunteered with newcomers through the English language learning programs at the Calgary Central Library. In the years before deciding to return to school to pursue a graduate degree, Dante worked as a front desk administrator at a dog sled tour company in Canmore, Alberta. Dante is an extroverted and caring individual with leadership qualities and aims to one day be the chief executive librarian of a system of libraries.\nJude Jamieson (he/him) is a 31-year-old originally from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Jude has an undergraduate degree in History from Acadia University. He spent his twenties trying to decide what direction he wanted his career to go. He has worn many hats, including baker, server and research assistant. Ultimately, he decided to pursue further education to work as an archivist. He feels his love of history and research will suit this profession well. Jude has utilized the archives in the past, working with the archivist at Acadia when he was writing his undergraduate thesis. He loves organizing and working with the artifacts that make up our past. Jude is an introverted, thoughtful and nostalgic individual and would love to work as a digital archivist.\nTracy Mina Brown (she/they) is a 40-year-old who grew up in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Tracy received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Amsterdam. Before applying for the MI program, Tracy worked as a professional in a non-profit organization and as a digital content manager. Her job requires this sort of confident, extroverted, team-player visage, which she does well, but then she needs and enjoys the quiet and focus of just doing the work alone. She enjoys being highly focused and sees this as a strength. Tracy is pursuing a career in knowledge management, preferably with a non-profit in the arts.\n\n\nSetting\nYou, Wren, Dante, Jude and Tracy have all just started your first year as Master of Information Students at Dalhousie University. You met during the orientation process put on by the university. While sitting on the patio at a pub down by the waterfront, you discuss what led you to the information profession or back to school.\nYou all sit down and order your food and drinks. You are curious and ask the others: What brought you to the MI program?\nJude: Well, my undergraduate degree was in history and focused on a Nova Scotian context. When I finished my degree, I worked as a baker for a few years, but I kept picking up side projects with the local archives in my town, transcribing documents online and digitizing my family’s cookbooks. After a while, I figured that if this was something I was interested in, I should pursue it as a career!\nDante: That’s so cool how you took your interests and turned them into career passions! I’ve always loved to read, and I’ve dreamed of opening a bookstore and coffee shop for years. I ended up going to school for psychology and business but realized along the way that opening a business wasn’t for me. I talked to a family friend who works as a librarian, and it seemed the perfect fit. I would still get to work with books and people but without the stress of keeping a business afloat. I want to make the world a better place, and I think libraries can help make that possible. Creating a space where people of all backgrounds can gather and where information and knowledge are free is so important! I know that to become a librarian, I’ll need the ALA accreditation, which affected my decision to apply to Dalhousie.\nJude: I also thought the ALA accreditation would be significant to have as an archivist. Looking over the competencies developed through this degree, it seemed that they would all be directly relevant to the skills I would need to succeed in my career.\nWren: I’m interested in the technology part of the program, and my goal is to land a data science position in a tech firm and then move up to a management role. I have a background in computer science, and what attracted me to the program is that it brings together technology, management, information, and people in a way that will be more beneficial for me than the computer science programs, which are very focused on technology.\nTracy: I came here after a career in non-profits. I have a fine arts degree; if you’re not a gallery or corporate artist, you work in non-profits. But I wasn’t formally trained to deal with an organization’s challenges. I mean, I can creatively problem solve, which they seem to appreciate, but honestly, just as much fails as often as it works, and I don’t even know why. So, while I really like the non-profit I was with and think their cause is amazing, I returned to school because I felt like every day I was just winging it. Knowing how things should and can work would be nice, rather than hoping they work!\nWren: That’s a good reason to apply to school, Tracy! Say, did our order get put through? I guess they forgot; it’s been like 45 minutes!\nDante: Ya, but look how busy it is here. The servers are run off their feet; I bet their communication is not ideal with this much going on.\nLooking around, they recognize the importance of information flows in this restaurant and all kinds of businesses. They realize that they have all experienced related issues in their previous careers.\nDante: I totally understand what it’s like to have issues with informational flow. When I worked at a dog sled tour company, there were always issues with the communication between the front desk staff and the customers. There was a tight cancellation policy, and if it was not understood properly, customers would end up paying for tours they couldn’t attend, and boy, that made them angry! No one wants to feel like they’ve wasted $400!\nWren: Jeez, I bet that caused a lot of headaches for the front desk! What did you think could have been done better to avoid those issues?\nDante: I think if we had a database and computer system that would keep track of our clients and bookings and send out automated confirmation emails, there would be a lot less room for human error and a better flow of communication! I found that the owners weren’t too open to my suggestions, so I made a point of returning to school to bring my ideas to a new organization!\nJude: Yeah, that’s a really good reason to quit! I worked as a baker and often dealt with supply chain issues. It wasn’t always appropriately communicated what was and wasn’t available, so it was hard to plan our menu. Customers weren’t always happy when we couldn’t have their favourite baked goods available, but we tried our best!\nTracy: People can be really grumpy in the morning before their morning cup and bagel, that’s for sure! When I worked at the non-profit, we spent a lot of time applying for grants and often found that the instructions for what was expected were not clear. This made it so hard to gain the funding we required. Every time I wrote one for our organization, I felt like I was making this stuff up, as I never really knew what people were working on in our organization or what projects they wanted to get done. Also, we were all over the place with people in countries around the globe – it was impossible to meet them all, let alone know what their ambitions were.\nWren: Wow, I never really thought about how lack of communication or misunderstandings can affect how so many businesses are run. I worked on several coding projects during my undergrad, and different people worked on the same code. Sometimes, that would be a mess when we didn’t have a shared understanding of the project’s goal or when people didn’t document their changes properly. That can get very inefficient and frustrating!\nYou have been sitting back and listening to the conversation between your new classmates. Consider the following questions relating to the conversation.\n\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhat are 1-2 benefits you think Jude will get from the MI program?\nWhat 1-2 benefits do you think Tracy will get from the MI program?\nConsider the benefits you provided for each Jude and Tracy. Were they the same? If not, how would you explain the differences?\nExamine the MI course offerings to propose a set of elective MI courses for Dante – explain your choices.\nWhat are 1 or 2 information problems you have experienced in your life up to now?

    "text": "Introduction\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, the occupational dimensions of the information society emphasize the increase in informational work: jobs are increasingly about producing, gathering, evaluating, sharing, publishing, processing, recording, storing, organizing, or managing data and information. Of course, some jobs may be more information-focused (e.g., a librarian or a data scientist) than others (a police officer or a manager). Still, most people are engaged in some informational labour at work. As information professionals, we may seek to understand how information shapes the working lives of individuals, the information issues they deal with at work, and how they can be addressed.\n\nInformation needs\nWorking tends to involve producing some outcome, which implies (ideally) having some knowledge of what to do and how to do it and making some decisions based (ideally) on that knowledge. The thing about knowledge is that it is never complete, and we almost always operate under a degree of uncertainty. In other words, there are often gaps between what we know and should know to perform our work optimally or make the best possible decision or action in a given situation. Circling back to the pyramid, we can think of those knowledge gaps as conscious or unconscious data and information needs that individuals have and that can only be understood in relation to the context. As we read about the workplace as an information setting, consider the purpose and context of individuals in the workplace and how that might determine their specific information needs."

Responsibility for decision making is also becoming increasingly decentralized and moving employees closer to customers. This change has led to a higher independence and responsibility for the individual employee, including responsibility for managing personal learning processes, allocation of time and focusing attention. As personal responsibility increases, personal information management is also becoming increasingly important, since swift access to relevant information often depends on structuring and managing information relevant to various work tasks.” (Byström et al., 2019)"

It can cause adverse outcomes like psychological stress, exhaustion, and decreased productivity (Matthes et al., 2020). It can also lead to decision paralysis or decreased decision quality (Benselin & Ragsdell, 2016). Information overload is not absolute. It exists at the intersection of the information quantity, the capacity of the individual to process it, the time available to do so, and the relevance/quality of the information itself, which can increase the amount of information and the amount of time needed to process it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nThink about your current role as a student at Dalhousie or another work setting you have experienced.\n\nWhat factors do you believe contribute to information overload in these settings?\nWhat strategies did you or others use to reduce or cope with the information overload?\n\n\n\nAs you reflected on information overload at work or in the university, you might have considered the role of technology. Perhaps you have thought about the ways that information technologies and instant messaging have made sending and receiving information more (and perhaps too) easy. You might have thought of mass emails with news, training, best practices, or other information sent by the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\n\nAbout 319.6 billion emails were sent in 2021; by 2025, this figure is expected to rise to 376.4 billion emails (Radicati Group, 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess issues\nProblems of information overload at work may lead us to mistakenly assume that we have more information than we need or that we have access to all the information we need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\nThink about a time you felt you did not have all the information you needed to perform a task at work or school.\n\nWhat barriers prevented you from getting the information you needed in that context?\n\n\n\nTransparency and information asymmetry are two concepts that, I would argue, fall into the category of information access issues.

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nAs we consider how workplaces can better manage information to serve their workers, we can be critical of the information practices we see in both traditional and emerging workplace settings. As workplaces change, we have seen how information overload and work-life conflicts can create and exacerbate information issues. When we seek information management solutions for these and other workplace problems, we can strive for ideals such as transparency, empowerment, and equality.\nWhile some tools can empower workers and meet their information needs, information management tools can also be used to inhibit those same needs. As we consider software tools for database management, knowledge management and employee communications, we must consider what other workplace expectations could be enforced by these systems. Consider reading this article on Amazon’s potential new worker chat app or the excerpt below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the news\n\n\n\nLeaked: New Amazon worker chat app would ban words like “union”, “restrooms”, “pay raise”, and “plantation.”\nhttps://theintercept.com/2022/04/04/amazon-union-living-wage-restrooms-chat-app/\n“The major goal of the program, Amazon’s head of worldwide consumer business, Dave Clark, said, was to reduce employee attrition by fostering happiness among workers —and also productivity. Shout-Outs would be part of a gamified rewards system in which employees are awarded virtual stars and badges for activities that”add direct business value,” documents state. At the meeting, Clark remarked that “some people are insane star collectors.”\nBut company officials also warned of what they called “the dark side of social media” and decided to actively monitor posts in order to ensure a “positive community.” At the meeting, Clark suggested that the program should resemble an online dating app like Bumble, which allows individuals to engage one on one, rather than a more forum-like platform like Facebook.\nFollowing the meeting, an “auto bad word monitor” was devised, constituting a blacklist that would flag and automatically block employees from sending a message that contains any profane or inappropriate keywords. In addition to profanities, however, the terms include many relevant to organized labor, including “union,” “grievance,” “payraise,” and “compensation.” Other banned keywords include terms like “ethics”, “unfair”, “slave”, “master”, “freedom”, “diversity”, “injustice”, and “fairness”. Even some phrases like “This is concerning” will be banned.\n\n\nAs information professionals, we may have roles in organizations that can directly affect not just the client’s needs but also the workers’ needs in organizations. By keeping the information needs of other people in mind, we can tackle the information issues we have seen in the workplace to create better work environments for all."

They have each completed a unique practicum in the spring/summer.\nDante worked at the North Memorial Public Library in Halifax, Jude worked at the LGBTQ community archives, Tracy worked for a non-profit arts collective creating taxonomies, and Wren worked at a tech start-up.\nYou run into Tracy and Dante in the common room on campus after you finish class one afternoon. They have been conversing about their practicums and are discussing some of the issues that came up in their short time at their respective organizations.\nDante: I’ve wanted to work in a public library for a while now, but the reality was different from what I had imagined.\nTracy: How so?\nDante: Well, there was a lot of bureaucracy involved. It was often hard to get things done because we had to get approval from so many different staff members before we could proceed with the programming we were planning. This was especially true when we were trying to create programs involving 3D printers. The financial cost was high, so upper management wanted to be more involved.\nTracy: I can see how that would be frustrating! I noticed a lot of inefficiencies at my placement as well. People were always complaining about the number of emails they received, often with information that wasn’t relevant to them or was repetitive.\nDante: That is so valid. We dealt with the opposite. There was a distinct lack of communication, and I felt like I wasn’t getting the information I needed to do the job I was hired for. I know I was essentially an unpaid intern, but I would’ve liked more direction.\nTracy: Or commitment from the organization, right? I found that I was expected to do much more than feasible. I also found that the organization I worked at really had a lack of boundaries. So many people wanted my attention and help; they would even email me during my off hours or the weekend! Seriously, I think I worked through every weekend, just trying to keep up! Not only did I not know how to do things, but I also had to seek out training or tutorials that the organization did not have.\nDante: Yes, these are all frustrating situations that could be avoided! I’m excited to run my library branch someday and work to fix these information flows.\nTracy: I agree! I hope that one of the benefits of being in an information management position is the ability to work through these informational issues and try to correct them.\nYou realize that Wren had snuck into the common room a few minutes ago.\nWren: This is all so interesting, but you know what it makes me think about? How information is everywhere, and all jobs are centered around information. My dad is a retired dentist and had to know so much about his patients. He had to refer to their charts to see when they had last had a checkup or check their x-rays for information on the health of their teeth and gums. Isn’t all of that an information process, after all?\nYou have been quietly observing the conversation between your classmates. You start to wonder about what issues with information flows you have encountered in your past work experience or even in school and how you might address them now as a student in information management. Tracy and Dante turn to you and ask you for your advice.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat do you think Dante could have done to make the information flows at the library more efficient? Do you think he can elicit change as a new employee?\nDo you think it was fair of Tracy’s employers to ask so much of her in a short-term position? What could she have done, or how could she have communicated that she sensed an overload of information?\nDo you feel the information flow at your last job or school was efficient? How do you feel it was compared to Dalhousie?\nWhat would you do to improve that flow and increase efficiency?\nDo you sometimes feel like you have too much information in your professional life? If so, how do you cope with this information overload?"

(Webster, 2014, p. 152)\n\nThe political economy approach also emphasizes the importance of considering the capitalist system as a whole, the role of power, control, and interest, and their significance for the information society. Some central points of Schiller’s theory are market principles and practices, corporate capitalism, the commodification of information, and class inequalities.\n\nMarket principles and practices\nAccording to Schiller, “the information environment is expressive of the interests and priorities of corporate capitalism” (Webster, 2014, p. 167). The primary purpose of corporations is the generation of profits, which leads to information being produced and made available only if profits can be made. This determines what information will be produced, by whom, for whom, and under what conditions it will be available. Moreover, under corporate capitalism, these decisions tend to be made by a limited number of large corporations that form powerful oligopolies.\n\n\nThe commodification of information\nAccording to Schiller and others, information is increasingly commodified to operate in a market society. This means that information gets to be something one can own, have a price, and be sold or licensed by a party to another (Webster, 2014). For information to exist as a commodity, there needs to be a legal framework that supports it, such as intellectual property law. In Canada, the Copyright Act protects the rights of content producers by granting them exclusive economic rights over their work (Al-Sharieh, 2018). However, the principle of fair dealing allows users to use copyrighted information without permission or payment of royalties. The “dealing” must only be for the following purposes: research, private study, criticism, review, news reporting, education, satire, or parody. Another exception is when a work is reproduced in alternative formats to increase accessibility for people with perceptual disabilities (Al-Sharieh, 2018). This highlights the need for a balance between the rights of the creator and the rights of the user (such as the right to participate in culture or the right to education).\nSchiller believed that information should be a public good, an idea that goes entirely against the dominant model. The struggle between the public good and corporate interests is well illustrated in scholarly publishing, which we explore in more detail below.\n\n\nClass inequalities\nClass inequalities also shape how information is produced and distributed, as class can determine what information one has access to. This brings us back to the digital divide from Chapter 3 on information issues. Schiller contends that the information society is one of “information stratification” where some (the minority) are information-rich, and others (the majority, or the “general public”) are information-poor. Furthermore, just like unregulated capitalism naturally leads to monopolies, the natural tendency of this system is to increase the gap between these two groups.\nWhen the ability to profit determines what information you will have access to, the information-poor are those who, by having the ability to pay, end up lumped together in what we call a “mass market” to which a “cheaper” kind of information can be sold without sacrificing profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat may be the effect of the dominance of market principles on the information produced, made available, and consumed by the public?\nHow do you think we can determine the value of information?\nDo you think that information should be considered a public good? Why?\nDo you think that you are information-poor or information-rich?\nIs there anything that we can do as information professionals to help with these issues?"

    "text": "The case academic publishing industry\nAcademic publishing is a highly profitable industry. Here’s how it works in a nutshell. Universities (funded mainly by students and taxpayers) pay the researchers’ salaries. The researchers ask for more public money to fund their research and hire research assistants, PhDs and postdocs to do research and write a manuscript to report the research and its results. They then submit the findings to a journal managed by an editorial board (all volunteers). One of these volunteers (although there are exceptions, as some editors-in-chief are paid) will recruit two or three additional volunteers to evaluate the submitted manuscript. After two rounds of reviews, the paper will be copy-edited, packaged, and sold back to the universities who already paid the salaries of all the people involved in producing and evaluating the work.\nConsider the suggested reading below for a much more detailed and accurate depiction of the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested readings\n\n\n\nThe following article is a compelling account of the publishing industry and its origins.\nBuranyi, S. (2017). Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science? The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science\nThis one is a bibliometric account of how the digital era led to an increased concentration of the publishing market in the hands of a few publishers.\nLarivière, V., Haustein, S., & Mongeon, P. (2015). The Oligopoly of Academic Publishers in the Digital Era. PLoS ONE, 10(6), e0127502. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127502\n\n\nIn principle, a published research article is unique: “each journal has the monopoly on the scientific content of papers it publishes: paper A published in journal Y is not an alternative to paper B published in journal Z” (Larivière et al., 2015). Furthermore, access to published research is crucial for researchers to stay current with the advances in their field and compete in a highly competitive research environment. This allows publishers to increase their prices without influencing demand, leading to hyperinflation of journal subscription prices that deplete academic libraries’ budgets (Shu et al., 2017).\nThe digitization of academic publishing and journals created an opportunity to reduce the cost associated with publishing and storing scholarly journals. The publishers introduced the journal bundles (the “Big Deal”), which indeed seemed like good deals until the continuous price increase of these bundles led libraries back to square one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of access to scholarly journals in Canada\n\n\n\nThe subscription fees paid by Canadian university libraries to some publishers are reported yearly and are openly available. The latest release of this data can be found in Brin (2021). Here are the subscriptions reported for Dalhousie University for the 2019-2020 fiscal year:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\nPrice (CA)\n\n\n\n\nScienceDirect-Freedom Collection, incl. Academic Press Collection\n$1,539,329.53\n\n\nWiley Online Library (Database)\n$801,401.41\n\n\nTaylor & Francis Journals (SSH/S&T/Medical)\n$301,280.04\n\n\nOxford Journals Online\n$125,574.14\n\n\nSage Premier All-Access\n$118,238.42\n\n\nWeb of Science\n$115,703.91\n\n\nScopus\n$69,254.69\n\n\nCambridge Journals Online\n$62,628.47\n\n\nWeb of Knowledge\n$48,556.76\n\n\nRSC Electronic Journals\n$23,965.30\n\n\nNRC Research Press Journals\n$16,348.20\n\n\nMathSciNet and Consortium Database Fees\n$14,125.01\n\n\nTotal\n$3,236,405.88\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unsustainable financial situation has led several universities to cancel journal subscriptions. In 2016, the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) launched the Journal Usage Project (JUP), a national evaluation of journal usage in universities to help libraries assess the state of their collection and either cancel the big deals or negotiate better prices with publishers. The results of this evaluation shed light on the concentration of journal use in Canadian universities, with almost two-thirds of the journals included in the Springer (now Springer-Nature) being considered essential for none of the universities included in the study.\n\n\n\nRelative frequency distribution of journals by the number of universities where they are used significantly (Mongeon et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nThe full results of the analysis sponsored by CRKN’s Journal Usage Project are reported in the following article:\nMongeon, P., Siler, K., Archambault, A., Sugimoto, C., & Larivière, V.

    "text": "Open access\nOpen Access is a movement aiming to make research output freely available online by removing barriers to access, such as subscription prices. The Budapest Initiative (BOAI) initially proposed two main open-access models. The first one, self-archiving (also known as green open access), allows researchers to deposit their already published articles in open electronic archives, also known as repositories. The second one, also known as gold open access, relies on a brand new type of journal that makes new scientific articles immediately available on its website, with no copyright restriction. These new journals would not charge for subscription or access fees. While the original BOAI declaration suggested that these new journals find alternative sources of revenue (such as grants or add-ons that could be sold as an extra), article processing charges (APCs), a publishing fee charged to authors, emerged as one of the primary sources of funding for OA journals. While the open access movement may have seemed like a break away from the commodification of scientific knowledge, the pay-to-publish model turned out to be, once again, an extremely lucrative business for publishers. Butler et al. (2022) estimated that the five largest publishers generated $1.06 billion in revenues from APCs during 2015-2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat role do you academic librarians and other librarians play (or could play) in supporting Open Access to the scholarly literature?"

    "text": "Case study\nThe gang have all moved on from their entry-level jobs and are starting towards the careers they hoped for while in school. Dante has become a public librarian at Saskatoon Public Library, Jude is working at the Nova Scotia Archives, Tracy is a knowledge management corporate consultant in Montreal’s arts and entertainment sector, and Wren has been promoted at the tech start-up she works for.\nDante and Jude attend a library and archives conference in Lake Como, Italy. The conference party, which takes place on a small, private boat, features many prominent professionals in Information Management.\nThe air is warm as the two disembark the boat at the end of the night, discussing the conversations. One speaker that resonated with both was Mallory Jensen, an Academic librarian from New York State. She spoke about her work negotiating with publishers to unbundle the academic journals her library purchases so that libraries can save money and only buy the journals their library desires.\nJude: I don’t have to deal with the issues surrounding big academic publishers because I work in archives, but Mallory is passionate about what she does. She shed light on how this is an issue with repercussions for all areas of the library. The budget significantly influences how resources are distributed in library settings!\nDante: You nailed it, Jude. I have met a few academic librarians through these types of conferences who are also frustrated by this issue. It is already so expensive for universities to purchase these journals. It just seems insane to force them to buy ones they don’t even want.\nJude: It really is! And then, on top of that, it’s ludicrous that universities have to buy back the research they’ve already paid their professors to do.\nDante: If only there were a way around it, like if the research could be found online, students and staff could just download and read it for free.\nJude: Arrrrghhhh, I know we just got off a boat, but Dante, you’re talking about piracy! Do you think that’s a fair solution? How can you guarantee that the authors are appropriately compensated if their work is illegally downloaded?\nDante: I guess I never thought about it that way. When there’s a new book I want to read with a long holds list at our library, I usually just go online and try to find a free copy to download. I figure I would be reading it for free through the library anyway, so what difference does it make?\nJude: The difference is that downloading it online is immoral! That is someone’s intellectual property. Waiting for a copy from the library or purchasing it at a bookshop is the right thing to do. You could also buy a copy online.\nDante: But why would I buy a digital copy when it’s so easily accessible for free? How can people be successful selling information online when there’s so much available?\nJude: What about open-access journals? There has been a significant movement towards them. They offer freely accessible content to democratize knowledge but usually charge publication fees to make the work they host publicly available. This remedies the problem of the end-user paying abominable subscription fees, though they carry their own issues. But at least we are moving in the right direction!\nDante: You’re probably right! Speaking of open access, why don’t we just grab an aperitif at that cute little restaurant across the street? It has a beautiful, uncovered patio, and it’s such a warm evening!\nJude: That’s a great idea, oh look! Mallory is sitting with a couple more conference speakers; let’s see if she can offer more insight!\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nDo you agree with Dante or Jude? Do you think that it’s fair for someone to be able to download a PDF of a book for free online when others are purchasing it legally? Why?\nWhat is your opinion on the oligopoly controlling all the academic journals libraries purchase?\nDo you think that these journal bundles should be unbundled? Why?\nHow do we determine value differently on an individual versus collective basis?\nAre you able to find your institution’s policy on Open-Access? How can institutional repositories and libraries help facilitate open-access publishing among faculty and students?\nFind 1-2 open-access journals online and try to determine how they generate revenue. What are your thoughts on the open-access movement?"

Misinformation occurs when someone unknowingly shares false information under the pretense that it is true, whereas disinformation occurs when someone deliberately creates and shares information they know is false (De Paor & Heravi, 2020). Fake news has been defined in many different ways but generally can be seen as false news articles that mislead the reader (De Paor & Heravi, 2020). Fake news is co-constructed by its audience because it automatically becomes fiction if the audience does not believe it. There are many kinds of fake news, including satire, parody, fabrication, advertising and propaganda.

    "text": "Origins of Misinformation\nMisinformation can arise in many different ways. One way is that rumours and fiction may be considered to be true. People are more likely to pass on information that evokes emotion regardless of if it is truthful. This is a common occurrence with information gleaned through gossip. People may also read fictional stories and believe their reading is accurate (Lewandowsky et al., 2012).\nThe government and politicians are also known to spread misinformation. People often cannot determine which information is true or false, especially surrounding elections. People often expect to encounter some misinformation during elections (Lewandowsky et al., 2012).\nThe media, including social media, are also spreaders of misinformation. The media can take accurate information from scientific studies and twist it in a way that can be misinterpreted- by oversimplifying, misrepresenting or over-dramatizing scientific results. The media often tries to portray balanced stories, but sometimes, this can create misleading outcomes. Social media, too, is a vast spreader of misinformation. Anyone can post information online without professional editors or fact checkers verifying the truthfulness of their statements. Hoax websites exist solely to spread misinformation- and disinformation. Selective exposure may also occur if people only seek out media sources that confirm their beliefs (Lewandowsky et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an example of a fictional story that was believed to be true?\nCan you think of a time when the media may have presented you with misleading information?"

In the Ted Talk below, Eli Pariser describes filter bubbles as “your own personal, unique universe of information you live in online”. The main problem with this is that people are not shown any opposing views, which only strengthens their current views. If the views held are false, they will still be shown more information that aligns with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n People believe and spread misinformation for a myriad of reasons. People often don’t know that something is misinformation until it is corrected. Even then, they may have difficulty believing the corrected information if it does not align with their beliefs. Worldview and personal ideology play a role in people’s willingness to believe misinformation- people will often argue anything that goes against their pre-existing worldview (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). People also struggle to identify whether or not a source is reliable. If an information source is persuasive, people are more likely to believe it is credible. People so rarely look into their sources that most often, people remember the gist of the information they read but not the source it came from. This shows how important it is for people to consider the sources they are getting their information from and whether they may be biased or misleading. It has also been shown that retractions often don’t work – people sometimes believe the information more after a retraction because they have been repeatedly exposed to it. This is because the more familiar information becomes, the truer it can seem (Lewandowsky et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPause and Reflect\n\n\n\nWith a friend, Google something related to a current event happening in the world and compare your results.

It has been defined as “the ability to think critically and make balanced judgements about any information we find and use” (De Paor & Heravi, 2020, p. 4).

Jude has had extensive experience creating and distributing podcasts as part of working with the LGBTQ Archives and helped community members create their podcast platforms. After getting the infrastructure set up and hearing from the forum member that the podcasts were doing well, a month later, Jude finally had time to listen in on the latest episode. Alarmed, Jude calls Dante late at night.\n*The phone rings, waking Dante up*\nDante: Jude, I hope you’re stranded in a desert or won the lottery because it’s 2 a.m.!\nJude: Hey, Dante, I’m sorry to wake you. Unfortunately, neither, though I kind of wish I was in the middle of a desert right now. I need to talk to you about something. Would you mind lending an ear?\nDante: Not at all, friend. You have to promise me that if you discover that you won the lottery at two in the morning one day, I’m still first on your list of people to call. But my ears are all yours.\nJude: You got it, buddy. To summarize, you know that podcast I was helping to get off the ground?\nDante: Oh yeah, the one run by the guy you met on that online forum you’re a part of?\nJude: Exactly. Well, I’ve been so busy with work and my personal projects that I haven’t been keeping tabs on it. It’s been a few months since I’ve listened to an episode, but I’ve heard from a few acquaintances that the podcast was doing well.\nDante: That’s great, Jude! Well done. You’re like King Midas of going viral! Everything you apply yourself to takes off!\nJude: Thanks, Dante. I wish this time it didn’t, though. I did some work late tonight and put the latest episode in the background. There was some pretty harmful content to the LGBTQ community on it. I’m abhorred. I can’t believe I was a part of setting up the infrastructure for this show and contributed to giving this guy a platform.\nDante: Oh no. That’s terrible. I’m sorry, Jude. Can you contact the podcaster and talk to him about it? Or remove yourself from the project?\nJude: Good suggestion, Dante. That’s definitely what I want to do, but I’m a little intimidated. This guy has a following that is growing by the day. I want to stop him from putting more content and messaging like this out there for listeners, but I’m worried about his influence… you know, I’m not very aggressive.\nDante: I know, Jude. I get it. It can be scary to take a stand. I can do it then! That’s my style- it’s time to bring some heat! They don’t call me Dante’s Inferno for nothing!\nJude: Thanks, Dante, but I don’t know… I need to think about this. Maybe I can write him a thoughtful email with some well-supported points, and he will reconsider his actions.\nDante: You know what? Wren will know what to do. Tracy will have a great perspective, too- but she has her kids, so I’ll let her rest.\n*Dante Facetimes Wren, and she joins their call. Jude explains the situation to Wren, and Dante offers their suggestion of butt-kicking*\nWren: Hmm… let me investigate this. [Typing]. From what I’ve found, his podcast stats show that his views are growing steadily, but they’re still menial compared to the big fish of the podcasting world. So that’s a positive thing… to slow them down even further, I could hack into the cloud and delete all the content and resources in his drive!\nDante: …who are you?\nJude: I’m nervous to say anything to him because I don’t want to do anything that could cause more anger and backlash directed against the LGBTQ community. I know what he’s broadcasting is wrong and harmful, but I feel it needs to be addressed in a way that wouldn’t inspire him to anger.\nDante: This reminds me of the library in Toronto that allowed an anti-trans speaker to give a presentation in their space. The 2SLGBTQIA+ community responded by having a protest outside the library and had more trans and trans-allies there than there were audience members who came to see the author speak.\nWren: That seems like an effective and powerful way to combat harmful perspectives like this. What do you think, Jude? Could you organize something like that in response to the podcast site? *Furious typing quickens* I’m looking at the podcast website- if I redirect the viewers to advertisements, it just sends them to extreme-right-wing funded organizations. Not a good approach. We’ll have to find another strategy.\nDante: Some information should be censored on mass media platforms like podcasts. Hate speech has no intrinsic societal value and is undeserving of protection.\nJude: I agree, Dante, but I wonder if counter-speech is better. Don’t you think the most vital ideals prevail? The minimal regulation in the podcasting world facilitates unfettered discourse, and there are much better ideas that promote love over hate!\nDante: Well, Jude, I think existing imbalances of power and prejudices make it difficult for marginalized communities to confront harmful messaging on equal footing.\nJude: I agree, Dante. Thanks for talking this through with me. Thank you both for all of your help. I feel like this situation is all my fault. You were right about those forums becoming feedback loops. I didn’t question or validate the information I was finding because it was so novel to me. I was looking for one thing and didn’t realize who I was surrounded by or influenced by. I don’t know what to do… I will think about it some more, but I know it’s unethical to ignore it.\nDante: We are glad you see that side of things now, Jude; we’ll always try to steer you right. It’s good you’ve recognized those things, and know we are here to help you in any way you need. Dante’s inferno is always ready to be unleashed; say the word.\nWren: Yeah, the podcaster took advantage of how helpful and kind you are. It doesn’t sound like he was upfront about the nature of his show with you or you never would have supported it. Now, Jude… what’s your laptop password? You are a good person, you’ll do the right thing, and I’m glad you called us. But… you don’t need to know what happens next. *Furious typing intensifies*\n\nEpilogue\n*Jude Facetimes Wren*\nJude: Hey, Wren, I just wanted to check in and see if there were any updates last night. What did you end up doing, after all?\nWren: Oh, Jude, that is classified information. Need-to-know basis, you know?\nJude: Wren, I appreciate it, but it won’t cause any backlash, will it? You can tell me; I won’t be upset.\nWren: Oh, Jude. I didn’t do anything wild. Also, you should probably stick to analog tech- the 1990’s called and want their website design back. Changing the SEO was super easy. There’s some technical stuff like root directories and assigning them not to be indexed, but I also changed all the keywords into Klingon. No one will ever find it! Bwahaha! (ghuy’cha’ in Klingon)\nJude: You are a genius, Wren! I am forever indebted to you and, at this moment, declare my undying servitude.\nWren: I’m just glad to have my friend Jude back. Now, sleep, and we can discuss your debt of servitude later!\n\n\nDiscussion Questions\nConsidering the themes of misinformation and disinformation and the conversation above, answer the following discussion questions.\n\nWhat is the difference between misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation?\nWhat sort of information is being spread/perpetuated through the podcast Jude helped to get started?\nHow can media and information literacy play a role in counteracting misinformation and disinformation?\nDo you think that media platforms (e.g. Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, etc.) are responsible for censoring content broadcast through their sites through policies that regulate harmful content, or should content and self-censorship be left to creators? Discuss.\nThe Edelman Trust Barometer, found here, is an annual global survey of over 36,000 respondents in 28 countries. The report was published in January and covered a range of timely and essential societal indicators of trust among business, media, government and NGOs, shaping the conversation and setting the agenda for the year ahead. Explore this tool and discuss the latest published annual report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the protests in Toronto, take a look at these articles:\n\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/hundreds-protest-controversial-writer-outside-toronto-library-1.4661036\nhttps://nowtoronto.com/culture/books-culture/toronto-library-meghan-murphy-protest/"

Avoid choosing a setting that is too large to be fully observed (e.g., Dalhousie University in Halifax or the internet).\nSubmit\nAn approximately 1,500-word text including:\n\nA brief description of the setting.\nThe type(s) of data/information/knowledge are at play in the setting.\nThe function(s) of information in the setting.\nThe interactions between people and information in the setting.\nThe factors that facilitate or hinder the information processes (e.g., use, access, exchange, etc.) in the setting.\nThe impact of technologies on the setting.\nThe implications/opportunities for information professionals."
